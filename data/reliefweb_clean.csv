""a number of factors worked against the monsoon since july-end. there have hardly been low-pressure circulations since then and conditions in the indian and pacific oceans have been unfavourable,"" said d sivananda pai, head of imd's long range monsoon forecasts. imd had forecast normal monsoon this year at 96% of the long period average, which it updated to 98% in june. poor distribution of rainfall has added to the distress. as many as 110 districts have had excess or 'large excess' (over 60% of normal) rainfall. in addition, heavy rain spells in gujarat, rajasthan and catchment areas in the himalayas (particularly in nepal) caused the worst floods in the country in 10 years. ironically, states such as up have seen both flood fury as well as the prospect of drought. the monsoon deficit in west up stands at 37%, highest for any subdivision in the country. of the state's 72 districts, rainfall has been deficient in 48. out of these, five districts — agra, hamirpur, mahamayanagar, amethi and kushinagar — face acute shortfall of 60% or more. this combination of poor rains and floods is likely to hit kharif output, although data till september 8 reveals that the sowing area this year is only marginally less than last year's, with the biggest drops seen in oilseeds, pulses and jute. several state governments have reportedly started drought exercises. poor rains have also affected water storage levels, important for winter crops. according to the central water commission data, live storage at 91 important reservoirs in the country was at 58% of capacity on september 8, the lowest in five years for which data was available. it was lower than the corresponding period during the drought years of 2014 (74%) and 2015 (59%), and significantly below the 10-year average of 69%. imd believes the second half of september could bring better rains in central india.

brahmaputra valley and barak valley) in the state which causes floods. the state faces acute flood problem in the flood plains of the river brahmaputra and barak and other smaller river sub-basins. assam has faced two waves of floods till 19th july 2017 affecting 29 districts out of 33 districts, resulting in loss of human lives, livestock and large scale damage to the dwelling houses. the state government is providing necessary relief assistance affected people in the state. as per information received from the state government of assam, about 59430.45 quintal rice, 11142.18 quintal dal, 3541.71 quintal salt, 37249.89 liters m. oil and 58092 numbers of tarpaulins etc. have been provided to the affected people in different districts of assam. the state government has mentioned that 1160 relief camps (357 relief camps + 803 relief distribution center) have been opened and 1,31,416 inmates are housed in these camps, so far. however, at present the situation is under control in the state. the state government is closely monitoring rescue & relief operations in the districts to deal with any eventuality. the ministry of home affairs is also keeping constant round the clock watch on the situation in the country including assam. in order to assess the loss of immediate nature, upon receipt interim memorandum an inter-ministerial central team (imct) was constituted on 21st july 2017. the inter-ministerial central team, in consultation with the state government, are visiting the affected areas of the state, from 25-28th july 2017 for on the spot assessment of damages of immediate and temporary nature. further, action would be taken in the matter, in accordance with the established procedure. to ensure effective preparedness, mha conducted annual meeting of relief commissioners/ secretaries, department of disaster management of state / uts on 17 may 2017 to review the status of preparedness and to discuss other disaster management related issues. the representatives of various central ministries/ organizations rendering emergency support functions also participated in the meeting. during the conference the emphasis was laid on close coordination with forecasting agencies such as central water commission (cwc), india metrological department (imd), gsi and incois. as stated earlier, the state governments concerned are primarily responsible for undertaking necessary rescue, relief and preventive measures in the wake of natural calamities. apart from providing logistics support, the government of india supplements the efforts of the state governments by extending financial assistance through state disaster response fund (sdrf) and national disaster response fund (ndrf) as per the laid down procedure. an amount of rs. 9382.80 crore has been allocated as central share to all the states in their sdrf accounts for the year 2017-18. an amount of rs. 3387.15 crore has so far been released, as the installment of central share of sdrf for the year 2017-18 to 21 states. in addition, financial assistance from ndrf amounting to rs. 1555.84 crore has been provided during 2017-18, so far, to different states which were affected by calamities of severe nature. in addition to regular schemes of crops damage, the farmers are also entitled for compensation under the pradhan mantri fasal bima yojna of the ministry of agriculture, which is being implemented by the state government. mha have deployed about 88 specialized teams of ndrf in 26 states and uts with 304 boats another necessary search and rescue equipment. based on vulnerability profile of different regions of the country, ndrf teams have been presently stationed/ deployed at 12 bn hq viz; guwahati (assam), haringhata (west bengal), mundali (odisha), arakkonam (tamil nadu), pune (maharashtra), vadodra (gujarat), bhatinda (punjab), ghaziabad (uttar pradesh), bihta (bihar), vijayawada (andhra pradesh), varanasi (uttar pradesh) and doimukh (arunachal pradesh). besides, pre-positioning of the ndrf teams has already been done at 31 different locations in the country depending on the vulnerability profile of the area. in addition, ndrf teams also assist to the state administration in distribution of essential relief material and provide medical support to affected people at the time of emergency. ndrf also conducts mock drills along with the relevant departments and state agencies in the country for effective management of floods, response and rescue operations. hon’ble pm has reviewed the flood preparedness of the nation via pragati on 12th july 2017. hon’ble mos (pmo & doner) has reviewed the flood situation of north-eastern states including assam on 13th july 2017. hon’ble mos (home) has visited and reviewed the flood situation of assam and arunachal pradesh from 13th to 15th july 2017. i would like to assure the hon’ble members that the government of india will give due importance to the valuable suggestions given by them during the discussion to deal effectively with the situation caused by floods and other natural calamities.”"
2017-03-22,https://reliefweb.int/node/1960219,"taking a holistic approach to water management  story highlights two-thirds of india is prone to droughts and one-eight is susceptible to floods. india’s complex hydrology calls for a holistic approach. the two hydrology projects have helped several communities in vulnerable areas to plan in advance and build resilience against the uncertainties of climate change. down the ages, droughts and floods have stalked the vast indian landmass. often, these specters go hand in hand, playing out their macabre spectacle in rapid succession. for, many a time, after a long scorching summer parches the land, dark monsoon clouds roll in from the sea, and the heavens disgorge their largesse with an unrelenting fury. year in year out, droughts and floods take an unforgiving toll. two-thirds of india is prone to droughts and one-eight is susceptible to floods. surging flood waters afflict some 32 million people each year, robbing the economy of anything between rs 6000 crore and rs 12,000 crores. drought affects a further 150 million people. although india as a whole is not a water scarce country, its water is unevenly distributed across both seasons and regions. some areas have too much water while others have too little. and, not all the water is available when it is needed most. add to this the increasing intensity of droughts and floods, as well as a rapidly growing population, and the impacts of these twin specters is becoming larger by the day. with half of india’s annual precipitation falling in just 15 rain-soaked days, droughts and floods are likely to remain a fact of life in the country,” explains anju gaur, senior water specialist at the world bank in new delhi. “the only way out is to fundamentally change the way we manage things.” it’s not so much a water crisis as a water management crisis clearly, india’s complex hydrology calls for a holistic approach. for a start, floods are not caused by heavy rains alone. the situation is often compounded by weak water management systems, faulty urban design, or rivers that have been unduly constrained by bunds and encroachments. quite often, floods are caused by the sudden release of water from reservoirs. “take the floods in bihar in 2016, in odisha in 2011, or the floods in the krishna river in andhra pradesh in 1998 that affected more than 2 million people,” says gaur. “most of these occurred in late august or september, when the reservoirs were full. when more rain fell, reservoir operators got just a few hours to release the excess water to prevent a breach, or else there would have been even more devastation downstream.” the main issue is that, until now, reservoir operators did not have the technological tools to help them take crucial decisions. rather, they were required to abide by strict schedules for the release of water that were often laid down in colonial times. if you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it now, for the first time in india, two hydrology projects – hydrology i (1995-2003) and hydrology ii (2006-2014) – supported by the world bank, have introduced new systems and technology that give reservoir managers an accurate picture of the water situation unfolding in their region. these systems have also laid the foundation for a comprehensive knowledge base that can improve the overall management of water resources in the country. “reliable data is a must for making better decisions,” says gaur. “this is especially important when you are dealing with such large volumes of water, as even small mistakes can have huge consequences.” ""with half of india’s annual precipitation falling in just 15 rain-soaked days, droughts and floods are likely to remain a fact of life in the country. the only way out is to fundamentally change the way we manage things."" - anju gaur, senior water specialist at the world bank making information travel faster than flood water the first project – hydrology 1 – focused on the peninsular states, where most rivers are straddled by a series of reservoirs (the western ghats in maharashtra alone are dotted with more than 1,800 reservoirs and barrages of both large and medium sizes). the second project extended its reach to cover the two water-rich northern states of punjab and himachal pradesh. to better manage water flows from these reservoirs, new systems now monitor all the important aspects of the hydro-meteorological cycle. measurement begins high up in the catchments of rivers, where digital gauges measure how much rain or snow has fallen, how rapidly the snow is melting, the speed with which the water is flowing, how much silt has built up, how much water will reach the reservoir, how soon it will do so, and so on. sensors in the field instantly transmit this information to data centres through satellite or mobile phone technology, enabling managers to form a clear picture of the water situation unfolding in their region. while these systems have been installed across peninsular india, the bhakra beas and the krishna-bhima systems have gone a step further. they now have a modelling tool that helps them predict water flows into their reservoirs three days in advance. this means that the lead time for planning the release of water from these reservoirs has shot up from just hours to days. “earlier it took lots of manpower and at least 24 hours to process this information from the field. not surprisingly, engineers often ended up doing a post-mortem of a flood rather than pre-empting one,” recalls gaur. now, whenever it rains heavily, reservoir managers can start releasing water slowly so that the reservoirs remain full while there is no risk to dam safety and no damage downstream. advance information is particularly important for the shorter peninsular rivers where it barely takes a few hours for the water to travel from the catchment to the reservoir. “sangli town in maharashtra, for instance, used to have flash floods whenever there was a sudden release of water from the koyna dam upstream,” gaur adds. “now this no longer happens.” these reservoir management systems, which cost a total of rs 30 crores, have helped avert flood damages of over rs. 238 crores. and, the results are there for all to see. in 2010, for instance, punjab, a highly flood-prone state, experienced some of the worst floods in its history, taking a huge toll on life and property. but, in 2013, when the rivers were in similar spate, no floods took place and there was no damage. this is not to say that floods will no longer happen, explains gaur. if the rains are unduly heavy, floods may well take place, but advance warning can certainly help save lives. these systems can also help alleviate the harshest impact of droughts. “a full reservoir is the best cushion against a drought in the dry season,” says gaur. “thanks to these systems, 2015 was the first time that all the krishna basin reservoirs in maharashtra were full by the end of the monsoon.” mapping groundwater with groundwater levels depleting at an alarming rate, the second project – hydrology 2 – used advanced geophysical techniques with helicopter-borne instruments to pilot the mapping of aquifers in five states – rajasthan, bihar, maharashtra, karnataka and tamil nadu. the technology is not only much faster and more accurate than other methods, but is also much cheaper. “groundwater modeling is an extremely complex subject,” explains gaur. “once the mapping is complete, we will get a much clearer picture of the groundwater resources in a region. it will also help in designing the best methods to recharge and manage this precious resource.” closer magnification can also throw up a host of new issues. “until now our information was on a scale of 1:250,000. once it is reduced to 1:50,000 or better, who knows what will come to light?” gaur adds. since water quality has emerged as another critical issue, the second project also helped states identify where the quality of groundwater has been affected by fluorides, nitrates, and other contaminants. monitoring water quality the second hydrology project also piloted water quality monitoring in surface water sources. thirteen real-time water quality monitoring stations were set up on the ganga and yamuna rivers. these stations proved extremely useful in maintaining water quality during the kumbh mela in 2013 when millions of people took the ritual dip in the holy river. real time readings from these stations helped determine when water needed to be released upstream on critical bathing days, and when it needed treatment. today, these stations continue to play their role on both these rivers, especially upstream and downstream of the capital, delhi. given the usefulness of these stations, 111 more such stations are being planned along the main ganga river. managing competing demands for water the systems and technology introduced under the two hydrology projects have much broader applications too. “if we are to manage our exceedingly complex web of water resources effectively, we need to know how much water the country has, when it has it, and where it has it,” clarifies gaur. “without accurate data on the existing water situation in the country, we are really shooting in the dark.” water data can also be a critical input in making development decisions. in pune, for example, a planned tunnel between two reservoirs to improve the city’s water supply was abandoned for a simpler, better and cheaper solution. accurate water data also provides a scientific basis on which to manage competing demands for river water, especially as disputes are often sparked by the lack of correct information. “accurate data can not only guide the sharing of river waters but also be used to better manage the fragile ecology of a river basin, help with better water resources planning and allocation during lean periods, design flood protection works, and so on,” explains chabungbam rajagopal singh, water resources management specialist at the world bank in new delhi. a third hydrology project, supported by the world bank, will now expand the water resources monitoring system to cover the entire country, including the indus, ganga, and brahmaputra-barak river basins. under this project, the ministry of water resources will provide states with a grant to collect water data for each river, stream and reservoir in their territory. the importance of sharing water data “importantly, we need to move beyond mere data collection to using it more effectively. for this, the willingness of organizations to open up their data and make it transparent will be the key, explains gaur. in addition, water resources institutions will need to be brought under one umbrella with one single agency to manage both ground and surface water. engineers and scientists will also need to evolve into water managers and take a river basin-wide approach to manage all water resources in an integrated manner. more importantly, riparian states and other stakeholders will need to come together to plan the allocation of river water during a dry year, a wet year and a year of normal rainfall, while being ready for climate change. “overall, the real and tangible benefits of the systems established under the two hydrology projects include people whose lives, homes, and crops are saved due to improved flood forecasting, farmers who benefit from improved irrigation supplies, and children who do not fall ill or worse from drinking contaminated water,” said halla maher qaddumi, senior water economist at the world bank in new delhi. “over time, it is hoped that accurate water data will also help reduce conflict between people and states over shared water resources.” leaders in transparency · the central water commission has created a state of the art platform that publicly shares national level water data online. · maharashtra shares real time water information together with streamflow forecasts, and audits water use by various sectors for each major/ medium reservoir. this is published annually on the web. · others states too are devising interim arrangements to display water information and joining the central platform on water resources information, while still others are yet to follow. · transparency is equally important for groundwater too. for, unlike surface water bodies which are managed by the government, the management of groundwater lies primarily in the hands of the people. andhra pradesh has been the first off the block in this, posting monthly bulletins and real time information on the groundwater situation on the chief minister’s web portal. · gujarat too is conducting an indepth analysis of the groundwater situation, particularly around the cities, to meet growing urban demand. · going forward both the centre and states will need to join hands to develop a sound national water resources information system and agree to make it accessible."

low pressure area which lay centred over coastal tamil nadu unleashed heavy showers ina continuous spree in tamil nadu during this northeast monsoon from the first week of november and has only abated on the 4th of december. so far there has been three spells of intensive rainfall. the first intensive spell of rainfall was from 8th and 9th november, followed by intensive rains again on 15th, 16th and 17th november. the first spell witnessed intensive flooding in cuddalore where most of the water bodies were full and the associated breaching affected the community’s life damaging house, infrastructure, etc. during the first spell the city of chennai experienced minor flooding to moderate flooding. the second spell saw chennai going out of gear as many settlements in chennai were flooded. the impacts of this spell stretched beyond chennai to adjoining district to chennai namely kancheepuram and tiruvallur, though the impacts in kancheepuram and tiruvallur was less compared to chennai. the third spell which is still on going has been more intensive than the first two spells and the impacts has exacerbated the flooding severely. this time chennai city was badly hit with nonstop rains, in some areas the flood water level was almost six feet high. entire neighbourhoods have been flooded, homes, shops and other establishments deluged. people have been marooned in the upper floors of homes.. many had to remain inside their houses without electricity as the whole city was flooded. people have been rescued and evacuated from the flooded areas by boats. the army airdropped food and water packets to the stranded families. the attributing reason for the same has been due to the heavy downpour on one side and the low level of water absorbtion capacity in view of the continuous rains since november first week. the process has completely thrown out of gear the normal life of people in many districts in tamil nadu. so far nearly 400 people have died and over 1.8 million people have been displaced. non-stop torrential rains since monday night (30.11.2015) pounded several parts of chennai and north tamil nadu triggering a deluge completely disrupting normal life as army was deployed today in two suburban areas to undertake rescue on a war footing.the flood situation continues to remain grim in the city and several parts of tamil nadu. the city still remains virtually cut off from the rest of the country with air, rail and road transport services. according to reports, chennai faces acute shortage of necessary items while the price of food grains sky rocket due to shortage. residents have complained about lack of medicines, milk, potable water and vegetables. meanwhile, indian naval ship ins airavat has reached chennai with relief materials. the government has deployed 1200 ndrf personnel, 100 boats and 200 divers to rescue stranded people in flood-hit areas. 40 army teams, 6 navy teams with 12 boats and several relief teams have been deployed in chennai to intensify rescue and relief operations. in several places, power supply and communication lines are down, adding to the misery. speaking to india today television, national disaster response force director general o p singh said 5 teams from patna and guwahati will soon leave for chennai while 5 teams from punjab have already reached chennai. another 5 teams from pune are all set to leave for chennai. some 164,000 people have been housed in 460 camps in chennai, cuddalore, thiruvallur and kanchipuram districts while thousands have also been shifted to others' houses after water entered theirs. at least 269 people have been killed to due to rain and flood related incidents in tamil nadu where thousands have become homeless. keeping in view the situation, chief ministerj. jayalalithaa has urged prime minister narendramodi to declare the unprecedented crisis a national disaster. chennai has suffered unprecedented destruction, with water overflowing from rivers and reservoirs seeping into scores of apartments and houses, markets, shopping malls, offices and educational institutions, unsettling life like never before. the floods have also killed 54 in neighboring andhra pradesh and two in pondicherry. a green body on friday said that the floods in chennai are an impact of climate change and the ""unprecedented deluge"" that the city has witnessed is a reminder of increasing frequency of such freak weather events across the indian subcontinent. the centre for science and environment (cse) said that chennai could have fared better if it had protected and preserved its natural water bodies and drainage channels. prime minister narendra modi on last thursday (3.11.2015) flew to chennai to take stock of the flood situation. after an aerial survey, he met with tamil nadu chief minister j. jayalalithaa and announced rs.1,000crore (us$ 151,515,151.52) for tamil nadu flood relief. he said this is in addition to the rs. 940 crore (us$

""even after 20 days of floods, the foul smell of rotten bodies of animals had filled the atmosphere. this could have led to outbreak of epidemics,"" he said. two main medical colleges of the state - government medical college and hospital and jvc medical college and hospital, both at srinagar - were reeling under water. the infrastructure of the hospital, including costly equipment, was destroyed. the entire wholesale market of medicines was completely submerged in water. the alternative arrangement of doctors and medicines was not in proportion to the amount required,"" said dr shakeel. there was also huge shortage of doctors, because native doctors of kashmir were themselves reeling under floods and hence not available for duty. nonetheless, many voluntary organizations were working there, he said."

2014-09-01,https://reliefweb.int/node/688081,"monsoon delivers a hard blow to farmers  flood and drought - farmers across the country have seen both as this year’s monsoon has featured late and erratic rains. this report details the situation as it is on the ground. high food inflation has been pinching indians for the last few months and with the current monsoon not being very generous to farmers, the situation is only expected to worsen. as of august 29th, rainfall deficiency in the country was 18 per cent, a much improved figure from the 41 per cent deviation recorded at the start of monsoon. this was all thanks to heavy showers, which also led to floods in odisha, assam and bihar. the indian meteorological department (imd) downgraded its prediction for overall rainfall deficiency from 7 per cent to 13 per cent, which brings the country closer to drought. a drought is declared when overall deficiency is more than 10 per cent and over 20 per cent of country’s area is affected by drought-like conditions. imd is still hoping for the figures to improve by the time the clouds recede from the country in september. most of the northwest, which makes the maximum contribution to the nation’s granaries, has not had much rainfall. the decline ranges from 65 per cent in the case of punjab to 40 per cent in eastern uttar pradesh. western rajasthan and vidarbha, two of the most water-stressed regions of india known for distress migration and farmer suicides respectively, are staring at a greater crisis if the current trend of deficient rainfall continues. by august 29, kharif crops were sown in 966.25 lakh hectares. last year, the figure was 998.01 lakh hectares during the same period. the major drop in acreage has been for coarse cereals, oilseeds and pulses. the centre has raised to 50 per cent the subsidy ceiling to buy seeds from the existing level. at present, seed subsidy is given in the range of rs 1,500-5,000 per quintal under the national food security mission depending on the varieties of seeds to partially compensate farmers for re-sowing crops in drought-declared areas. however, none of the states has declared drought yet. “drought has become a political issue in india. if a state government declares drought, it has to pay 50 per cent of the relief amount to the farmers before the centre releases its share. today, each state wants a relief package but without having to shell out anything,” sharma says. the major reservoirs of the country were filled to less than two thirds of their total capacity (155.05 billion cubic metres) on august 21, which is 85 per cent down from last year. this will not only impact irrigation of both the kharif and rabi crops, but will also impact the production of power, some of which is again used for irrigation through tubewells.

""we're despatching about 35 to 40 small relief trucks daily. however, if there are roadblocks in the distribution process, we do not know of it,"" said manu bhardwaj, a volunteer at the sports college storage camp in raipur, dehradun. government officials confirmed they had received over 400 large relief trucks since june 22 when supplies started pouring in from various parts of the country. additional rations are still coming in from gujarat, punjab and haryana. ""we were told rations will be distributed to us on wednesday, thursday and friday. however, the days passed without any relief,"" said arvind sharma, resident of flood-hit pandukeshwar village. in mana, the last indian village along the indo-tibetan border, only 40 of the 200 families said they have received their share of relief. a tea-stall owner, bhawani, said, ""although the administration announced it has completed the distribution of relief material to mana, we've no such information."" also, contrary to its promise of reaching relief to every family, the government is handing over supplies to tehsildars and village sarpanchs, leading to allegations of discrepancy and biased distribution. expressing satisfaction with the way the government has handled relief though, revenue secretary bhaskaranand joshi said, ""the government was focusing on getting pilgrims out first. relief will follow."" supplies for flood-hit people include food grains, clothes, ready-to-eat food, used and new clothes and utensils, among other things. although large quantities of bottled mineral water are also being supplied, volunteers managing relief camps said this is mostly needed in uttarkashi. describing the government's decision to send in mineral water as shortsighted, joint advisor, operations, at the national disaster management authority, vinay kajla, said, ""instead of bottled water, the government should have sent in a water filtration or treatment system. no one seems to have thought what will happen once relief supplies dry up and people are forced to return to the old sources of drinking water. in places like the kedar valley, the risk of water contamination will be high."""

2012-07-23,https://reliefweb.int/node/512568,"preparations for monsoon  the central government has prepared extensive plans to deal with the deficiency in the monsoon/rainfall in some parts of the country.  the government is in full readiness to address any situation that may arise due to any rainfall anomalies.  the prime minister has been apprised of the situation and has directed all departments and ministries to co-ordinate efforts with state governments to meet any eventuality and monitor the situation on a weekly basis. situation so far the progress of the monsoon so far has not allayed earlier concerns.  the rainfall deficiency which existed at  the end of june has lessened somewhat, but the intensity and spread of rainfall over the next week or so needs to be watched carefully, especially in karnataka, maharashtra, gujarat and rajasthan the india meteorological department's second stage forecast on 22.6.2012 predicted rainfall over the whole monsoon season to be normal at 96% of long period average (lpa) with model error of ±4%, but this is now reportedly likely to be around the lower end of the range.  as on 15.7.2012, monsoon has covered all parts of the country.  the cumulative rainfall for the period from 01.06.2012 to 15.07.2012 is 22% less than the lpa.  rainfall over the four geographical regions of north-west, central, south peninsula and east and north-east india for this period has been lower than their lpas by 33%, 26%. 26% and 10% respectively.  punjab, haryana, rajasthan, saurashtra and karnataka have till now received low rainfall.  on the other hand, the north east region, north bihar and north bengal have received and are likely to continue to receive heavy rainfall.  the overall figure of 22% deficit can, however, be misleading as the unevenness of distribution and periodicity of rainfall are also factors to be taken into account. the 84 major reservoirs in the country that are being monitored by central water commission have now begun to get filled but the current year storage is still 61% of last year storage and 78% normal ten-year average storage.  however the levels in the reservoirs in madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh and rajasthan are more than the ten yearly average.  the ministry of water resources indicates that there is no real cause for concern as the reservoirs are now getting filled with heavy rains in the foothills of himalayas, north-east and parts of southern india. there has been reduction of around eight million hectares in the crop area sown compared to last year. while the reduction in area sown in case of rice could be covered over time,  area reduction in coarse cereals is likely to persist. steps taken: a. contingency plans have been prepared by the department of agriculture and cooperation and shared with the states.  these will be rolled out in the areas which continue to receive low rainfall. b. there is sufficient availability of all seeds including of coarse cereals and pulses.  in assam, which is affected by flood, seeds of submergence tolerant varieties are being provided.  similarly, for flood prone north bihar and west bengal, sufficient seeds and such varieties are available. c. suitable advisories regarding fodder availability have been issued in the states by the department of animal husbandry, dairying and fisheries.  these include preservation of crop residue that may be used as fodder in the nest season.  sufficient funds for this purpose are available with the state governments under various schemes. d. sufficient seeds for various fodder crops such as maize, sorghum and bajra are available and will be made available to the state governments, as and when required. e. all options for increasing fodder availability under joint forest management programme will be explored by the ministry of environment and forests. f. power availability for agricultural purposes will be ensured so that yield of rice is not adversely affected.  unallocated power of approximately 300 mw each is being made available to punjab, haryana and up by the ministry of power.  this represents about 75% of the total unallocated power available for the northern region.  in addition, secretary, ministry of petroleum and natural gas has been asked to ensure availability of diesel in the states, especially in north west india. g. the need for according the highest priority to drinking water was stressed. the ministry of drinking water & sanitation will henceforth be monitoring the status of the affected habitations on a weekly basis, rather than on a fortnightly basis as is presently being done. h. adequate reservation for drinking water in the reservoirs will be ensured. states have been advised to phase out the release of reservoir water for irrigation in a way that in the event of there being less rainfall later on further requests can be met. i. while the prices of wheat and rice are stable, the prices of sugar, pulses and vegetable are showing an upward trend.  a proposal for increase in subsidy for supply of pulses through public distribution system to bpl families is being brought before cabinet committee on economic affairs by the ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution. j. any additional requirement for wages under the mgnrega scheme will be met by the department of rural development.  rs.12,000 crore have already been released to the states during the current year.  states have sufficient funds in hand.  increase in demand for employment has been reported only from a few states so far.  the shelf of works to absorb additional labour has been kept ready with the states. k. sufficient funds to the tune of rs.4524 crore are currently available under national disaster relief fund. l. an inter-ministerial group under secretary, department of agriculture and cooperation is reviewing the situation on a weekly basis and also holding video conference with the state governments."

""we have completed our all preparations for flood control and cleaned up all season rivulets in the district,"" claimed patiala dc g k singh after a meeting of flood coordination committee. however, there are no takers for the official claims. ""we have not seen any cleaning of any rivulet,"" said some farmers working in field near devigarh. the dc is apparently completely unaware about the agitation and signature campaign launched by residents of tafajalpura, gurbax colony, guru nanak nagar, new bishan nagar, purana bishan nagar, deen dyal upadhya nagar, ram nagar, sst nagar, mathura colony, jagdish colony and many other areas last sunday to protest against the lack of cleaning of chhoti nadi. the residents have now decided to approach the chief minister for the cleaning of chhoti nadi as they fear that it may not only cause floods but also lead to an outbreak of epidemic because of the dirty sewage water discharged in it. ""the administration is lying. we request the punjab chief minister to take strict action against all officers, who have sent fake reports of cleaning and order a high level inquiry to know the utilization of funds,"" they demanded. sources said there are around 17 drains in patiala and many other seasonal rivulets and rivers like ghaggar, tangri, markanda and pachi dara. in 2010, lack of cleaning had led to around 50 breaches, which led to floods and losses of rs 63 crores in 200 villages of patiala. estimates prepared by the district drainage department reveal that it needs at least rs 6.50 crores for the repair and cleaning of water channels."

2011-05-13,https://reliefweb.int/node/401633,"hansi-butana wall worries punjab villagers   sangrur: as if a swelling ghaggar during monsoons was not enough for causing damage, the construction of a 10-foot high concrete wall along the hansi-butana canal in haryana is also expected to severely affect people living near the seasonal river. the residents of about two dozen villages situated near ghaggar`s banks are a worried lot because of the construction. they have decided to approach state and union authorities against this. the wall would block the flow of flood waters towards guhla-cheeka side in haryana and would keep it back in villages of sangrur and patiala districts, say residents of the area. punjab had challenged the hansi-butana construction in supreme court. ""injustice is being meted out to residents of about two dozen villages already living at the mercy of the authorities` attitude as the construction of the wall along hansi-butana in four-km area would ensure flooding of these villages completely,"" said ghaggar control committee chairman jugraj singh hotipur. hotipur said it was suggested long back that haryana be allowed to use ghaggar water from hansi-butana regulator during paddy season, but no heed was given to the suggestion. makrod sahib resident joginder singh said people had still not forgotten floods of 2010 and with the construction of hansi butana wall they would have to face more such problems, as at that time, some of the water had spread into haryana allowing the flood`s intensity to come down. he added that construction of the wall would prove disastrous for many punjabi villages and if state authorities did not come forward in saving villages, they would be ruined if ghaggar showed its fury. state irrigation minister janmeja singh sekhon said punjab would oppose the wall`s construction strongly and the matter would soon be raised before union government."

2010-07-20,https://reliefweb.int/node/361647,"india: ignoring flood warnings, punjab, haryana engage in blame-game  chandigarh: as punjab and haryana engage in mudslinging over the recent floods that have left them counting their losses and looking up to the centre to foot the bills, the disturbing question is whether the two governments can absolve themselves for doing precious little in preventing a ''manmade"" situation despite forewarnings. with disaster management conspicuous by its absence, a punjab irrigation official, requesting anonymity, said, ""ghaggar, known as the river of misery in the two states, can be tamed with the help of three damns. but the two governments have been bickering over their construction for several years."" earlier this year, when toi had contacted paswan bansal, union minister of state for water resources, on ghaggar's notoriety, he too blamed the states saying, ''they have to resolve the issue between themselves."" but nothing has happened, with the river, once again, causing mayhem. also, two years ago, punjab is learned to have cautioned the central water commission, centre and other agencies on impending floods because ""design of the under-construction hansi-butana canal was structurally faulty"". in a letter written to the central government, late cooperation minister capt kanwaljit singh had cited a study by rakesh khosa, senior professor at iit, delhi: ""... heightened floods will cause extensive damage in punjab and the canal may prove to be an environmental hazard... also no provision has been made for draining out sheetflow...."" punjab is still found severely wanting in safeguarding embankments or rushing relief to the flood-hit. army has been summoned to plug breaches, while marooned villagers have cut roads and embankments of empty channels to drain water from their areas. on its part, haryana too has failed to apprehend threat from the breaching hansi-butana. and though the government wants the abandoned satluj-yamuna link canal to be operational at any cost, it has done nothing to carry out repairs in the neglected canal, which has given into fissures. flood victims are naturally furious. ''it's shameful how governments blame farmers for causing breaches, even threatening to book us. are we supposed to stand and watch while our children starve and crops died. the water has to be drained out and so we have cut roads or diverted flood waters to empty channels. no government has come to help us,"" said kultar singh, a patiala village farmer. meanwhile, both states have made a case for huge compensation packages from the central government - haryana's astounding rs 1,346.81 crore and punjab's preliminary estimate of rs 300 crore even as assessment is still on in sangrur and mansa districts. punjab has also demanded damages of rs 10,000 against the existing rs 1,600 per acre of crop loss."

and with the world health organization, networks of people living with hiv, government ministries and civil society organizations under the regional health and care programmes. the south asia regional office also maintained strong cooperation with the international committee of the red cross (icrc) and links with the world food programme, united nations development programme (undp) and united nations agency for international development (usaid). further, close cooperation was continued with international media agencies like reuters, bbc and cnn for efficient information flow, especially during disasters. the international federation, on behalf of the national societies in the south asia region, would like to thank the above mentioned partners for their generous support."

2008-08-29,https://reliefweb.int/node/278448,"india: floods - information bulletin n° 4  glide fl-2008-000145-ind the state of bihar is facing one of the worst floods in 50 years, as the river kosi in nepal has discharged huge levels of water, running down to the bordering districts of bihar and inundating them. a two kilometre long breach in the mud embankment has led to a change in the course of the river kosi, which has caused this flooding, including inundation of those districts in bihar which have not been affected by floods in past 50 years. so far, 2.6 million people have been affected in the state and 47 people killed(1) since the breach occurred earlier this week. the state administration was not adequately prepared to handle such a situation. presently the interagency group in the state and the government are mobilising resources to combat the situation in the state and to set up an emergency relief operation. the indian red cross society (ircs) has taken a lead, with its trained volunteers and staff at the state and district levels. the ircs national headquarters has been in regular contact with its branch, monitoring the day-to-day development of the floods. the prime minister of india has declared the bihar floods a national calamity. he undertook an aerial survey of the affected areas and declared a relief package of inr 100 million (chf 2.5 million or usd 2.3 million), along with the release of 0.1 million tonnes of food grain for the state. he has given an assurance that a high-level committee will interact with the nepal government regarding control measures for the kosi flooding. the situation on 18 august 2008, a major breach (about 2 kilometres in length) occurred in the eastern embankment of the kosi river in kusha (indo-nepal border). more than 3.7 million litres of water was discharged through the breach, flooding hundreds of villages in the districts of northern bihar. government sources (national disaster management division) have indicated the following figures so far: no. of district affected 16 no. of villages affected 1,598 no. of people killed 47 no. of people affected 2.6 million no. of houses destroyed 227,969 the 16 affected districts include muzaffarpur, supaul, patna, katihar, nalanda, araria, west champaran, shekhpura, saharsa, purnea, saran, begusarai, bhagalpur, madhepura, vaishall and khagaria. due to this huge breach in its embankment, the kosi river has changed its course and is now flowing through areas that have not experienced major floods in the recent past. since the affected areas were traditionally not flood prone, people as well as the local administration were not adequately prepared to deal with the floods. in the affected districts, the road linkages as well as water and electricity supply are badly disrupted. railway tracks at several places have also been submerged. another major area of concern is that due to continued flow of water from the breached embankment, displaced people will not be able to go back to their original locations for at least another two or three months. as the water will not recede until the embankment is repaired, until then people will have to stay in relief camps being run by the government. most of the displaced population that is staying in the open does not have temporary shelter material and very few have plastic sheets. therefore, they have to make do with bed sheets and sarees (women's clothing item). the general hygiene conditions in the camps are very poor. as toilets in the camps are inadequate, people are resorting to open defecation. this poses a great health risk with water and vector borne diseases. a few cases of diarrhea have already been reported, which has the potential to increase given the scorching heat, unsafe water and poor environment conditions. the prime minister of india has declared the bihar floods a national calamity. he undertook an aerial survey of the affected areas and declared a relief package of inr 100 million (chf 2.5 million or usd 2.3 million), along with the release of 0.1 million tonnes of food grain for the state. he has given an assurance that a high-level committee will interact with the nepal government regarding control measures for the kosi flooding. the indian meteorological department has forecasted scattered to widespread rainfall and isolated heavy showers over parts of some north-eastern states of india (arunachal pradesh, sikkim and meghalaya), sub-himalayan west bengal, bihar and along the west coast during next four to five days. according to indian red cross society (ircs) sources, the flood situation in the state of assam, on 28th august, also turned grim with vast tracts of land inundated by the rising of the brahmaputra river and three of its tributaries to danger levels in several districts of the state. this posed a serious threat at morigaon, nagaon, dibrugarh, nemati and dhuburi districts. morigaon district was inundated with fresh floods, with 80 villages and 6,800 hectares of paddy fields being severely affected. according to ircs sources, the states of punjab and uttar pradesh have been receiving light to moderate rainfall with intermittent heavy rains in some parts of the state. so far, 1.6 million people have been affected from 3,686 villages in 21 districts in uttar pradesh and 194,675 people have been affected from 849 villages in 11 districts in punjab. a total of 12 million people have been affected throughout the country this year and approximately 1,600 people have been killed in 19 states2 (himachal pradesh, andhra pradesh, uttar pradesh, uttarakhand, bihar, assam, jharkhand, west bengal, orissa, tamil nadu, kerala, karnataka, goa, maharashtra, madhya pradesh, gujarat,
