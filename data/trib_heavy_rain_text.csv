"Vijay Mohan Tribune News Service Chandigarh, August 21 While reducing the outflow from Bhakra Dam’s floodgates tonight, the authorities have decided to bring down the water level in the reservoir, which is hovering near the top mark, by at least 5 feet over the next few days to handle the possibility of any future weather event as well as to counter the unusually high deflection of the dam’s structure. “The water level this morning was 1,679.5 feet, which will be brought down to 1,675 feet. A special technical committee meeting to review the situation was held yesterday in which all members of the partner states were of the view that the water level should be reduced by five feet,” said DK Sharma, chairman, Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) today.  In the evening, the BBMB decided that in view of inflows reducing to 45,000 cusecs and forecast of low rainfall in the coming weeks, the discharge from the spillway would be reduced from 41,000 cusecs to 18,500 cusecs. The spillway gate opening would be lowered down to four feet from the present eight feet. The reservoir’s permissible limit is 1,680 feet and the water level had gone past it following heavy rain in the catchment area. At present, the BBMB is releasing 40,000 cusecs through the spillway, in addition to 36,000 cusecs through the power generation tunnels to reduce water levels.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });  “After assessing inflows, the BBMB had released more water during May and June. The level had been brought down by 20 feet from 1,624.18 to 1,604 feet by June 25, before the onset of monsoon,” Sharma said while trying to dispel public misperception that floods were the result of water being released from Bhakra. Stating that the BBMB had no option but to discharge excess water, Sharma said a host of factors, including quantum of inflow, meteorological forecasts, seepage levels and deflection of the dam had to be taken into account. “The deflection experienced this time was among the highest such recorded instances due to the intense pressure of water,” he said. Pointing out that this year, Punjab had experienced the worst floods since 1988, Sharma said controlled release of water could successfully handle the situation. The gates of the spillway were initially opened only by three feet and thereafter by eight feet. In 1988, the gates had been opened up to 22 feet. The maximum discharge capacity of the spillway is four lakh cusecs.  Peak water generated in the Sutlej at Ropar headworks during the floods was 2.4 lakh cusecs, most of which came from rivulets downstream of the dam. Rajasthan’s requirement is 12,500 cusecs and since there is no storage means downstream of Ropar, water eventually went waste by flowing across the border. Sharma added keeping in mind the long-term health of the dam and condition of the reservoir, several projects had been initiated. This includes allocation of Rs 220 crore for undertaking a study and related works under phase-2 of the Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project that would cover structural, hydrological, seismic and geo-physical aspects. Further IITs at Roorkee and Ropar had been roped in to identify areas along the reservoir’s periphery that were prone to silt inflow and to assess the commercial exploitation of silt dredged from the reservoir bed.  Reservoir level status Permissible 1,680 ft Current  1,679.5 ft Target 1,675 ft  Water flow Current inflow 45,000 cusecs Current discharge 41,000 cusecs Target outflow 18,500 cusecs"

"Tribune News Service  Bathinda, July 18 A day after Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal and Finance Minister crossed swords over the issue of waterlogging in Bathinda, it was the turn of their local leaders to indulge in a blame game even as the city residents continued to reel under the misery caused by heavy rain here on July 16. Former Akali Dal MLA Sarup Chand Singla and District Congress Committee (Urban) president Arun Wadhawan held separate press conferences and resorted to political bickering over the matter. Addressing mediapersons, Wadhawan said, “Harsimrat tried to shift the blame on Manpreet Badal despite the SAD-BJP alliance in power at the local level (MC). Mayor Balwant Rai Nath and former MLA Singla always claimed of not having funds, but MPLAD funds are still lying unused.”  (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });He said last year, Manpreet released Rs 75 lakh for the cleaning of sewerage on July 7, Rs 50 lakh for installation of new motors on October 5 and a grant of Rs 56 lakh for beautification of Sanjay Nagar, DAV School, Sanguana Basti ponds on October 5. He said the previous SAD-BJP government gave a contract of Rs 211 crore to Triveni Company for laying sewerage and water supply pipeline in the city, but the project was still not complete despite putting extra burden of Rs 30 crore on state exchequer. Meanwhile, SAD leaders lashed out the Congress leaders for allegedly not ensuring proper drainage of rainwater in the city. Former SAD MLA Singla alleged that Manpreet failed to honour the poll promise of resolving the problem of sewerage and drainage. Singla said, “Till now no funds have been released for this purpose. The state government is deliberately not providing funds to the MCB.” Earlier, Harsimrat had accused Manpreet of stopping sludge carrier line work aimed at doubling the capacity to drain out water from low-lying areas. She also charged him with diverting corporation funds to the Improvement Trust. On the other hand, Manpreet blamed the SAD-ruled MC for the situation. "
"Balwant Garg Tribune News Service Faridkot, July 17 A jail room of historical importance at Jaito, where Jawaharlal Nehru was kept in September 1923 for violating prohibitory orders of the British by participating in Jaito Morcha, collapsed after incessant rain on Wednesday. In this 240 sq ft room, Nehru was confined along with K Santhanam and AT Gidwani on September 22, 1923, for defying order banning entry to princely state of Nabha. Jaito town was part of Nabha state that time. This jail room was in shambles for the last many years.

The Congress had sent Nehru, Gidwani and Santhanam to get first-hand information about political developments. But when they entered the state, they were arrested for want of permission from the British administrator of Nabha, said Goyal. After keeping Nehru and his two comrades in this jail for a day on September 22, 1923, they were shifted to Nabha jail and the court had announced two-year-jail for them on October 3, 1923. Both Jaito and Nabha jail rooms, where Nehru had been kept, are in a bad shape. Santhanam, who died in 1980, in his memoir “Handcuffed with Jawaharlal” had recalled how they were lodged in a separate and secluded part of the jail which had mud walls. The room was 20 ft by 12 ft. The roof and the flooring was made of mud."

"Tribune Reporters Chandigarh, September 22 Thanks to the widespread rain on Saturday and a similar prediction for the next two days, Punjab is likely to finish this monsoon with normal rainfall. It will be the first time since 2011 that the state will have a normal monsoon. With Saturday’s rain, the state has so far recorded 393.9 mm rainfall this season and till the fourth week of September, 468.1 mm is expected. The state was 16 per cent deficient, but according to the Chandigarh Meteorological Centre, the entire gap is likely to be filled with the current spell. The state had last witnessed a normal rainfall in 2011. At that time, it was 7 per cent above normal. Twelve districts have so far witnessed normal rainfall. It was deficient in six districts — Bathinda, Moga, Muktsar, Jalandhar, Amritsar and Kapurthala — and scanty in Mansa, Fazilka and Ferozepur. Ropar district witnessed excess rainfall with around 1,000 mm so far.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The current spell of rain will start receding on Monday, while some isolated places will receive heavy rainfall.

Jagmohan Singh, state general secretary of BKU (Dakaunda), said those who had sown short-term varieties of paddy would suffer the most as the harvest had already started reaching the market. He said the discolouration of  high-quality basmati would affect crop prices. The ongoing showers will also delay harvest, he added. “There have been no case of crop damage so far, but if it continues to rain incessantly tomorrow and strong winds blow, then it can result in major crop damage,” said Baldev Singh Latala, state vice-president of the All India Kisan Sabha. In Malwa, cotton farmers are a worried lot, apprehending crop loss due to incessant rain. Though the area under cotton cultivation came down in Malwa this year, the farmers were expecting a bumper yield. However, with the forecast of heavy rain in the state for three days just around the harvesting time, they fear the worst now.  The cotton had started arriving in the market in areas such as Fazilka and the farmers were upbeat, as their produce was already fetching a price of above Rs 5,800 per quintal. Agriculture experts have advised the farmers not to irrigate their fields in view of the rainfall, as it increases the threat of flattening of crops, if strong winds accompany the rainfall. Earlier this year, the government had raised the MSP of cotton from Rs 4,020 to Rs 5,150 per quintal. Kamal Deep Singh, a farmer from Jalandhar district, said most of the paddy sown on nearly 1,500 acres had got submerged. “We have been asking district officials to provide pump sets for draining out water. It seems unlikely that the standing crop will survive if it continues to rain till Sunday morning.” In Patiala, the district administration is keeping a close watch on the water level in the Ghaggar.

The gain is almost 30 per cent more than the Rs 4,510 per quintal price they fetched for the same crop last year, said sources in the Market Committee. The arrival of cotton has started picking up in Fazilka district, one of the largest cotton-producing belts. After the commencement of the cotton arrival season on September 1, the district saw arrival of more than 2,400 quintals of cotton last week, sources said. An expert, Satish Dhingra, predicts that the price would touch more than Rs 6,000 per quintal in next few days.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Farmers are hopeful that the per hectare yield of cotton crop will break all previous records in the state, especially if the weather remains favourable for a few more days. “The input cost of the crop, too, has decreased this year. However, the first half of this month is crucial for the crop. If there is normal rainfall with slow wind, there is no threat to the crop. But the heavy rain, accompanied by speedy winds, can damage the crop. As of now, the whitefly is below the economic threshold level (ETL),” said Sukhdev Singh Sidhu, Deputy Director, Agriculture Department-cum-Nodal Officer for cotton, Punjab. Agriculture Department officials are expecting the average yield to remain 780 kg lint per hectare. The previous record was in 2016, when the yield remained 756 kg lint per hectare. However, in 2015, the whitefly attack on the growing crop had decreased the yield to 197 kg lint per hectare. The cotton growers in other areas have also started getting good price for the crop. Some farmers recently sold raw cotton with seeds at Rs 5,400 per quintal. Notably, the MSP of the cotton crop (medium staple) has also increased this year from Rs 4,020 to Rs 5,150 per quintal. According to experts, high price is also due to area-wise decrease in cotton cultivation, which has acted as a demand booster. This year, nearly 2.84 lakh hectares was brought under cotton cultivation in the state — Bathinda (1.1 lakh hectares), Fazilka (70,000 hectares), Muktsar (52,000 hectares), Mansa (40,000 hectares), Sangrur (6,600 hectares), Barnala (4,400 hectares) and Faridkot (1,100 hectares). The total area in the state, however, remained below the target set by the Agriculture Department. “The expected record crop will attract more farmers and help in breaking wheat-paddy crop cycle,” said Prof SPS Brar, an agricultural scientist, who had served at Punjab Agricultural University. (With inputs from Praful Chander Nagpal in Fazilka) The Target  Year                             Yield (Kg lint per hectare) 2006                             750 2015                             197 2016                             756 2017                             750 2018                             780 (expected)"

"Varinder Singh Tribune News Service Bathinda, September 13 The Gurmeet Ram Rahim episode has cast its shadow on the cotton belt of Punjab and Haryana. Cotton growers are facing a tough time as the number of cotton pluckers from neighbouring Rajasthan has gone down drastically. In a double whammy for farmers of Punjab’s sprawling cotton belt spread over eight districts — Bathinda, Mansa, Muktsar, Ferozepur, Sangrur, Barnala, Faridkot and Moga, the region has been lashed by heavy rain, causing huge losses.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Crop loss in the entire cotton belt has been pegged at over 7,000 acres even as the Punjab Agriculture Department is still assessing the damage. The professional cotton pluckers from Alwar in Rajasthan are reluctant to come with their families to Punjab or Haryana in the aftermath of the Gurmeet Ram Rahim episode apparently for the fear of violence. It has been a decades’ old practice for hundreds of Rajasthan-based labourers specialising in cotton plucking to move to Punjab and Haryana from the last week of August and stay here for two months. Their main attraction was the better remuneration in Punjab and Haryana. In the past, they have been getting Rs 500-600 per acre apart from add-ons like wheat flour, tea, milk, ‘faraata’ fans and accommodation. Another major reason for their staying away is the suspension of rail services on the Sirsa-Rewari or Hisar-Bathinda sections for more than a fortnight due to the fragile law and order situation in the two states. “Farmers have no choice but to pay more money to local labourers apart from extra facilities like increased quantities of wheat flour, tea, ghee, vegetables, pulses and spices. We cannot say no as the crop can be devastated by rain anytime,” said Gurdarshan Singh, a cotton grower of Bathinda. The shortage of cotton pluckers has touched such a point that some farmers have sent their family members or relatives to townships or villages situated along the Rajasthan border so that they could arrange labourers as soon as they land on Punjab’s soil."
