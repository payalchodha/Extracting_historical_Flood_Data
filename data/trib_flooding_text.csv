"Tribune News Service  New Delhi, October 3  Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday urged the Central Government to take up canalisation of the state’s three eastern rivers of the Indus water system as a national project, to enable conservation of water and enhancement of the region’s economic growth.  In his proposal presented to Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a meeting here, the Chief Minister suggested construction of high-speed economic corridors on 985 km long river embankments, apart from river training works, flood protection measures and lining of internal side-slopes of the Sutlej, Ravi and Beas. The move, Capt Amarinder said, would help the state enhance its ‘jal shakti’ (water power) to encourage diversification of agriculture, promote quality urbanisation and colonisation, and to speed up industrialisation for better and quicker economic emancipation of our citizens.    Complimenting the Prime Minister on his initiative to provide drinking water to each household in the country, through the creation of the new Ministry of Jal Shakti, and the inception of Jal (water) Jeevan (life) Mission and the “Nal se Jal” (tap water) scheme, Captain Amarinder said his government also stands committed to the cause of providing drinking water to its citizens under the initiative ‘Har Ghar Pani, Har Ghar Safai’ (water and sanitation for every household).  The Chief Minister, while expressing concern over the state’s reduction in ‘jal shakti’ at the time of India’s Partition and against during the reorganisation of the state in 1966, pointed out that the three perennial rivers of the Sutlej, Ravi and Beas irrigate only about 27 per cent of the state’s cultivated area, leading to over-exploitation of the ground water. It is apprehended, he further noted, that seven districts of the state will transform into a desert in the near future, with sure signs of poverty revisiting these areas.   Underlining the need to increase water productivity through augmentation and strengthening of water management, control and regulation infrastructure, Captain Amarinder suggested launch of the cannalisation project with the Sutlej river, which would require an investment of about Rs.4000 crore (US $ 0.7 billion) over a period of 3 to 5 years, exclusive of external incentives such as commercial exploitation of Government and private land and waiver of taxes, duties and cesses, as relevant. The task may begin with a feasibility study that may be assigned to techno-economic experts of international repute, he suggested.  The Chief Minister assured that the state would extend its full cooperation to get the proposal realised in terms of sending a team of officers from the Punjab Government to engage and discuss the same with the officials of the Union Ministry of Jal Shakti.   Captain Amarinder also underlined the need to harness the river water which was currently flowing into Pakistan during the monsoons. Pointing out that the three rivers as of now have kutcha (earthen) embankments, measuring 945.24 km; (Sutlej 484.12 km, Ravi 245.28 km and Beas 215.84 km), covering almost over 60 per cent of state’s area, he observed that the 1/3rd of the state’s population living in the riverfront areas was also suffering due to the flooding that occurs during the monsoon period. The canalisation of rivers and development of riverfront areas will expand activities leading to widening of the base of Punjab’s economy, diversifying economic activities and sources of livelihood for State’s rapidly growing younger generation, he added."
"Kulwinder Sandhu Tribune News Service Moga, September 22 A farmer of Talwandi Bhangeria village in Moga district has saved at least 62 lakh litres of water in his paddy fields in just two months. A team of the Jal Shakti Abhiyan, led by PK Mishra, Director, Financial Intelligence Unit of the Union Government, has inspected the fields of progressive farmer Baldev Singh, who has adopted the technique of sowing paddy directly, thus saving water. As per the information, Baldev had sown paddy on 7 acres with direct sowing technique and on another 7 acres with the traditional method of flooding the fields, on experimental basis. He installed meters on the pumps irrigating the fields to calculate the usage.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Dr Jaswinder Singh Brar, Plant Protection Officer, who accompanied the team, said when they compared water usage after two months, the team found that the farmer had saved at least 62 lakh litres of water by using the new technique. The farmer told the visiting team that he was practicing the technique for the past couple of years and had saved water as well as power worth around Rs 1,100 per acre. Brar said the paddy fields with direct sowing method require irrigation once a week while those with traditional methods require irrigation two times a week. Many studies claim that directly seeding rice into fields than transplanting it into flooded fields also reduces methane emissions and slows down climate change, he added. Director PK Mishra commended the farmer for his exemplary work and appealed to farmers to do away with traditional technique and instead sow paddy directly to save maximum water, which is the need of the hour. Change technique to save power, water  Pertinently, 41.58 lakh hectares in Punjab is under cultivation. Of which, irrigation with the help of 14 lakh tubewells is done on 29.54 lakh hectares while canal water is used to irrigate just 11.16 lakh hectares If Baldev's claims are to be believed, Punjab could save Rs 770 crore on power by sowing paddy directly on 28 lakh hectares. These figures can be increased by bringing more area under canal irrigation and adopting rain harvesting practices The Central Groundwater Commission has already declared 116 of the total 138 revenue blocks in the state as “dark zones” for over exploitation of groundwater "
"Anirudh Gupta Ferozepur, September 9 Following rise in the Sutlej level and subsequent flooding of areas along the border in this sector, Pakistan-based drug peddlers have been trying to push consignments inside the Indian territory through the “vulnerable” riverine gaps where fencing could not be erected. On Monday morning, the alert BSF troops of 136 Battalion thwarted the third consecutive attempt to smuggle heroin inside India through the Sutlej taking advantage of water hyacinth in the river. The BSF men seized five packets of heroin from an area near the Shameke border outpost, which was being pushed through the water channel. Since the Sutlej zigzags along the border in this sector, Pakistani smugglers try to exploit these riverine gaps to execute their sinister designs, said an official. However, special motor boat nakas have been set up, besides continuous patrolling is also being carried out to prevent any such infiltration and smuggling attempts. Two days ago, the BSF men had foiled another bid to smuggle 3 kg of heroin into the Indian side through the riverine gap in the Sutlej, which was stashed inside a rubber tube and concealed in water hyacinth to evade any suspicion. That consignment was also seized from the Shameke border outpost. In another similar attempt, 14 packets of heroin weighing 15.12-kg worth Rs 75 crore was seized from an Indian smuggler identified as Harjinder Singh, alias Jinder, of Palla Megha village two weeks ago. He was swimming across the Sutlej with the consignment hidden in the tube. The BSF had also recovered a magazine, 31 live rounds (7.63 mm) along with a Samsung mobile and two Pakistani SIMs from him.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Youth held with 1.5-kg heroin  Khanna: The local police have arrested a youth at a naka and recovered 1.5 kg of heroin worth Rs 7.5 crore from his possession.

When SDM Narinder Singh visited the site to take stock of the situation, the enraged villagers gheraoed his vehicle and tried to push his vehicle into the river. The vehicle’s windscreen was broken. Later, the SDM filed a complaint to the SSP, Ferozepur, and subsequently a case was registered against the accused under Sections 186, 342, 353, 427 and 149 IPC at Makhu police station. Those named in the FIR are Surjit Singh, Harnek Singh, Chanan Singh of Gatta Badsha and Gurbhej Singh of Jaimal Singh Wala, besides some unidentified persons.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });"
"Aakanksha N Bhardwaj Tribune News Service Jalandhar, September 8 Floods have affected everything, including relations which are yet to be materialised. Marriage proposals, which were in process of finalisation or reached at almost final stage, were wiped out. The dreams of getting married and starting a new life had started taking shape on 19-year-old Usha Rani’s (name changed) mind when the family of the man she was getting married to came to their house and asked to finalise the date. The very next day floods washed away everything along with savings her parents had kept for the marriage. Her family in Mundi Cholian village had planned to do marriage within a month but now they are left with no other option but to postpone it. This is the sad tale of the families who had saved for their daughter’s marriages throughout their lives and now that everything has gone, the families are in a dilemma whether they should gather themselves first or think of marriage.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); New permutations and combinations have started taking shape. Now, shape of relations will depend upon the gravity of loss caused by floods. Usha Rani’s mother Dalip Kaur said that after years of hard work they had gathered money and ornaments for her daughter’s marriage, but she was still finding out what had got washed away and what was left with her. “We have lost our cattle. Our kutcha house has developed cracks. There is knee-deep water in the house,” the worried mother said. Harmesh Singh of the same village is also disturbed. Marriage of his 20-year-old sister Kirpal Kaur (name changed) is due next month. He had bought a washing machine and a bed for her marriage which are now redundant. Singh says his father has been unable to work for the last 12 years due to fracture in his leg. Harmesh is the only one earning. The crop on two-acre land he owned and the other two acre which he had taken on lease has got destroyed due to the rain fury. His father Gurbachan Singh says, “Three days before floods hit our village, the groom’s family had asked us to fix the marriage date. After that, the catastrophe destroyed everything and now we are waiting for the water to recede fully and then we will think about marriage. Also we will have to tell them that there is not much left with us now.” Another villager, Tarsem Kaur, had kept the savings for her daughter’s marriage in a protected manner, but now she finds nothing in the submerged house. “We had a meeting due with the family of the boy. “We had a mediator who was going to arrange the meet. We had thought that if everything goes well, within 15 days, we would get our 20-year-old daughter Sangeeta Rani (name changed) married,” Kaur said, adding that after this disaster, it was too difficult to arrange them together and start a new life. The sufferers said that no one else could have even a slight feeling of the problems these flood-affected villagers have been facing. For the outer world, this deluge means only about flooding, water receding, schools opened and electricity connection restored, but only the people of this area know what havoc this has brought and what hopes and desires have been washed away by the flood. House, cattle lost After years of hard work, we gathered money and ornaments for our daughter’s marriage. I am still finding out what got washed away and what remains with us. We have lost our cattle. Our kutcha house has developed cracks. Dalip Kaur Not much left Three days before floods hit our village, groom’s family had asked us to fix the marriage date. Now, we are waiting for the water to recede fully and then we will think about marriage. We will tell them that there is not much left with us. Gurbachan Singh Dream shattered A mediator was about to arrange our meeting with a family for our daughter's marriage.

In view of the difficult financial situation faced by Punjab may I request that a liberal financial package by the Centre be approved for Punjab.” — TNS5(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });"
"Ruchika M Khanna Tribune News Service Chandigarh, August 31 The calamity that struck Punjab on August 18, when heavy downpour led to rise in water level of the Sutlej and Beas, could have been averted to a large extent. The encroachments on riverbeds and along the banks of the Sutlej, large-scale mining of sand and inability of the government in clearing crops, poplar tree plantations and wild growth from riverbeds collectively led to the massive flooding in six districts. Admitting that there have been lapses by the successive state governments, the Capt Amarinder Singh government is now willing to right the wrongs, and avoid such disasters in future. Though the Sutlej and Beas were in spate following a heavy downpour, had the successive governments kept tabs on the said violations, it is likely that the damage and flooding would not have been as massive as witnessed now.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Wherever the ownership of dried-up riverbeds is in private hands, farmers have gone for poplar plantation or grown crops. And the tracts of land where ownership rests with the government, the drainage wing of the Department of Water Resources, working on a skeletal budget, failed to clear the wild vegetation. The Northern India Canal and Drainage Act, meant to regulate irrigation, navigation and drainage, is clear that even at places where ownership is in private hands, the government has the power to prohibit and remove obstructions in the natural flow of water and recover the cost from the owner. Government officials agree that the Act has barely been put to use in recent past, leading to tree plantations and overgrowth of vegetation in river beds, that obstructed the gushing waters and led to flooding along embankments. Official sources have told The Tribune that the state government had allocated Rs 100 crore to the drainage wing for this year, of which over Rs 30 crore was spent for relining the river banks and a similar amount for cleaning the drains.  Since the project of Rs 418 crore to clear the riverbeds of encroachments and for flood management programme in the two rivers, is pending with the Central Water Commission (CWC), the state had no resources. Trees and wild growth obstructed the flow of water in the Sutlej, where not just BBMB released water to protect the dam, but water flowing in from the Swan (89,000 cusecs) and Siswan (65,000 cusecs) rivers, too led to the overflowing of the river. Officials admit that another major reason behind flooding was mining. Illegal miners seem to have weakened dhussi bundhs. The BBMB authorities have often said mining was a serious issue. Even World Bank had earlier refused to fund a project for channelising the seasonal rivulets that flow into the Sutlej because of mining (legal and illegal). At many places, large tracts of riverbeds have been encroached by squatters as well as colonisers. Over 1.47 lakh acres of the Sutlej floodplain (land adjacent to the river) has been encroached upon. Sources say that the Sutlej river, as it meanders downstream thins to a width of just 20 ft from 100 ft as it nears Ropar, especially near the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT). With illegal construction remaining unchecked for decades, this too contributed to flooding as unprecedented discharge of water was witnessed. Survey begins in Phillaur, Shahkot  The Jalandhar administration has started the process to conduct girdawari in flood-hit villages to assess the loss suffered by farmers and locals. Teams of revenue officers have started the process in Phillaur and Shahkot subdivisions. DC Varinder Kumar Sharma said as per preliminary report, crops in 82 villages in the district had been destroyed due to floods. He said of these, 52 villages were in Shahkot and 30 in Phillaur. oc "
"Ravi Dhaliwal Tribune News Service Dera Baba Nanak, August 30 A 105-minute meeting of the Kartarpur corridor technical committee was today held between officials of India and Pakistan at the zero point —the place where the Indian and Pakistani sides of the proposed corridor converge. The meeting was held amid tight security. This was the first meeting ever since India revoked special status of Jammu and Kashmir, leading to tension between the two neighbours. The project is being established to mark the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev.  As in the past, no official briefed the media on what exactly transpired during the meeting. Sources claimed Pakistan was asked to speed up the construction of a 300-metre bridge on its side. “Initially, Pakistan officials were reluctant to construct the bridge. Citing security reasons, they kept on insisting they would build a causeway instead. When we pointed out that the causeway would lead to flooding of Dera Baba Nanak, they agreed to build the bridge,” said an official. India has already completed 70 per cent of the work on the 100-metre bridge being built on its side. Over the past few months, several rounds of meetings have been held to discuss corridor alignment, coordinates and other engineering aspects.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); With Kashmiris till last breath ""Today, all of us are standing with the Kashmiris.

"Islamabad/Gurdaspur, August 30 Officials from India and Pakistan on Friday discussed in a cordial atmosphere the technical modalities like the level of roads and the bridge of the proposed Kartarpur Corridor for Sikh pilgrims, the first such meeting after New Delhi revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s special status leading to fresh tensions between the two countries. The meeting at the Zero Point, where the Indian and Pakistani sides of the proposed corridor converge, was attended by 10 to 15 officials from each side, an official of the National Highways Authority of India, who attended the meeting, told PTI. The meeting lasted for close to two hours during which various technical aspects pertaining to the corridor were discussed, Chief Engineer with NHAI, T S Chahal, said. Officials of the Ministry of Home Affairs, BSF, Land Port Authority of India, which is constructing a state-of-the-art passenger terminal building, also attended the meeting. The corridor will connect Darbar Sahib in Pakistan’s Kartarpur with Dera Baba Nanak shrine in Gurdaspur district and facilitate visa-free movement of Indian Sikh pilgrims, who will have to just obtain a permit to visit Kartarpur Sahib, which was established in 1522 by Sikh faith founder Guru Nanak Dev.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); This was the first meeting on the Kartarpur Corridor after India on August 5 revoked Article 370 of the Constitution, which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir, and bifurcated the state into two Union Territories. Chahal said the technical issues regarding the level of roads and the bridge of proposed corridor, were also discussed. Medical facilities which would be provided to pilgrims during their visit were also discussed. In the meeting, which was held in makeshift tents at the Zero Point, both sides discussed timing of completion of the bridge, alignment of the roads and other engineering aspects of the proposed crossing points. “The meeting was held in a cordial atmosphere,” said Chahal. He said various works relating to the corridor would be completed well in time before the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak in November. So far, there is no official word from the Pakistani side on Friday’s meeting. The area where the meeting took place was heavily guarded and no media personnel was allowed to go near the venue. However, the devotees and local people were allowed access to a point on the Indian side from where they could see Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib. Pakistan and India have been discussing the modalities regarding the opening of the corridor at Narowal, some 125 km from Lahore, on the occasion of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak in November. Over the past few months, many rounds of meetings have been held on the corridor during which the experts from the two sides have discussed its alignment, coordinates and other engineering aspects of the proposed crossing points. In July, delegations of the two countries held a meeting on the Pakistani side of the Attari-Wagah border to discuss the modalities of the Kartarpur Corridor, which will also be the first visa-free corridor between the two neighbours since their independence in 1947. Pakistan is building the corridor from the Indian border to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, the final resting place of Guru Nanak, while the other part from Dera Baba Nanak up to the border will be constructed by India. India is constructing a bridge at the Zero Point and has urged Pakistan to build a similar bridge on its side that will provide safe and secure movement of pilgrims and address concerns regarding flooding. The bridge is over a creek of which the majority part falls in Pakistan. Tension between India and Pakistan has escalated after New Delhi revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s special status. Reacting to India’s move on Kashmir, Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled the Indian High Commissioner. PTI"
"Deepkamal Kaur Tribune News Service Jalandhar, August 28 Over the years, crores have been spent on irrigation and flood control on the 1,400-km dhussi bundh in the state. Around Rs 22.66 crore has been sanctioned for this fiscal too. But after witnessing last week’s flood havoc across Jalandhar alone, it now seems that either the funds were less or these were improperly utilised as the Sutlej banks unexpectedly gave way at 18 points, leading to the worst-ever disaster. As many as 21 villages remained flooded in Phillaur and Shahkot subdivisions for nearly a week with huge losses incurred by all departments, including the PSPCL, Railways, School Education and Agriculture. Even though the final estimates for the repair work of the bundhs are yet to be prepared but it is learnt that all big and small breaches would require at least Rs 10 crore. Though the villagers have been venting their ire against the Drainage Department for their alleged laxity, the officials are not ready to accept any fault at their end.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); “What could have we done when nearly 2.75 lakh cusecs of water came flowing from the Bhakra and its tributaries in one go? Our bundhs have been designed only to bear water up to the capacity of 2 lakh cusecs. Water at some places was flowing over the berms. Had the bundhs not been strong enough, there could have been 500-600 breaches going by the amount of water that suddenly flowed in,” said Chief Engineer, Drainage, Sanjiv Gupta. A junior engineer said, “The Jalandhar circle that includes embankments falling in five districts (Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Nawanshahr, Ludhiana and Hoshiarpur) got only Rs 4-5 lakh. The most affected Lohian-Shahkot area, which falls in the 45-km section, got just Rs 30 lakh. This amount gets used up in cleaning just 15 km of drains.” Talking about the reasons for Lohian villages bearing the maximum brunt, drainage officials said, “This area forms a deadlock with gates at Harike lying shut. There was no way for water to go beyond. So, the water got collected here, which just kept on spreading, flooding more villages each day.” DC Varinder Kumar Sharma said, “I do not want to get into the debate on the working of the Drainage Department. I am more concerned about getting all breaches plugged. All breaches in Phillaur have been filled. We’ve got access to four-five breaches in Lohian beyond Janian Chahal village. We have taken permission to carry sandbags across the Gidderpindi track between 7 am and 7 pm.”"

The IMCT has been mandated to visit Meghalaya, Assam, Tripura, Bihar, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala to make final recommendations to the Centre for allocation of flood assistance to the flood-ravaged states.  Singh said he had already written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking a special flood relief package of Rs 1,000 crore for compensating the losses resulting from floods in the state.  It is estimated, as per initial calculations, that the state has suffered damage worth Rs 1,700 crore.  Singh, who was extensively touring the affected areas, had also urged the prime minister to instruct authorities to waive crop loans availed by affected farmers from banks/financial institutions during the current cropping season.  Recent rains and release of excess water from Bhakra dam to Sutlej river had caused extensive damage to standing crops and had inundated residential areas in several districts including Jalandhar, Kpaurthala, Ludhiana, Ferozepur, Rupnagar and Kapurthala.  Meanwhile, Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, Balbir Singh Sidhu, Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria, Gurpreet Singh Kangar, Bharat Bhushan Ashu and Punjab Assembly Speaker Rana K P Singh spent the day overseeing the relief and rescue operations in Doaba and Malwa. Sarkaria said the work of plugging a 175 feet-wide breach near Bholewal village in Ludhiana and a 380 feet-wide breach at Meowal village in Jalandhar would be completed by Saturday night. Meanwhile, Bajwa donated one month's salary to the CM Relief Fund. Additional Chief Secretary Vishavjeet Khanna said in Jalandhar that the state government would provide free high-quality wheat seeds to the affected farmers for the upcoming Rabi season. Khanna, who visited the flood-hit villages in Jalandhar, said the basic motive was to extend a helping hand to the farmers in this hour of crisis. He said they would be provided high yielding varieties of seed as apart from their crops the flood water also destroyed the seeds. PTI"
"Anirudh Gupta Ferozepur, August 22 With hostile neighbour (Pakistan) on one side and the ravaging Sutlej on the other, farmers residing in villages along the India-Pakistan border here are seemingly caught between the proverbial “devil and the deep sea”. Not only the hostilities between the two countries have a direct bearing on their well-being, the Sutlej too plays havoc with their lives almost every year. Scores of villages, including Tindiwala, Kaluwala, Chandiwala, Kassoke, Kamalewala, Khunder Gatti, situated between the zero line and right flank of dhussi “bundh” face this nightmare of floods almost every year. In 1988 and 2006 these villages were totally submerged. Even during normal days, the only mode of transportation available for some of these villages is wooden “bera” (indigenously built boat), which ferries them to the mainland. However, when the river is in spate, they remain trapped inside their “kutcha” houses as even the “bera” no longer remains safe. “Almost every second year, the river water inundates our dwellings,” Mangal Singh of Chinniwala village said, adding that his fields had been wrecked by the Sutlej thrice in the past five years. Echoing similar sentiment, Darshan Singh said: “Every year, the same story is repeated but nothing has changed on ground.” Shingar Singh said: “What to talk of floods, we otherwise also don’t have access to basic amenities such as education, healthcare, potable water, sewerage or proper roads. We have got used to even floods now.”(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Kulwinder Singh said: “Even the claim of compensation is a farce. After running from pillar to post, we got meagre compensation for the damage caused to our crops. But even those cheques bounced when deposited in banks.” Chanan Singh said: “Even when it comes to personal matters like getting the right matrimonial alliance for prospective brides and grooms, we are the suffering lot. People from other parts of the state are never willing to get their sons or daughters married in our villages due to the fear of either floods or war.” “Now, we have started losing hope. Frequent flooding of our fields has shattered our financial condition,” said Maggar, adding: “Working in fields under hawk’s eye of gun-totting BSF sleuths, we do not have enough resources or skills to go and settle elsewhere but do not want our children to settle here now.” “The government had promised to transfer the land in our name but nothing has been done yet,” said Desha Singh."
"Ruchika M Khanna Tribune News Service Chandigarh, August 21 Even as the state remained on the edge, with almost 75,000 cusecs water being released by the BBMB, the government is grappling with the issue of compensating farmers, who have suffered losses worth crores. The government has been dilly-dallying on formulating a crop insurance policy, which could have been useful to compensate farmers whose losses are now estimated at Rs 750 crore. In such a situation, the relief that the state can offer is just Rs 12,200 per hectare (or Rs 5,083.33 per acre) from the State Disaster Relief Management Fund, unless the Centre recognises flooding in Punjab as a natural disaster and gives it a flood relief package.  It is only then the cash-strapped state can look at a more decent compensation to be awarded to farmers. At places, where the farmers have suffered a loss of more than one crop (in Fazilka- Abohar, where besides horticulture crops, cotton is grown), Rs 5,625 per acre would be given for loss of horticulture crops and Rs 5,083.33 per acre for other crops sown along with kinnows. Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh today wrote to the Prime Minister, seeking a Rs 1,000-crore special package, besides asking him to instruct the authorities to waive crop loans taken by farmers in affected villages for the current cropping season. The flooding in the Sutlej due to discharge of water from Bhakra Dam has caused extensive damage to crops, inundating 326 villages of Ropar, Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Moga, Ferozepur and Kapurthala. It is estimated that crop on 1.20 lakh acres of cultivated area is submerged.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Official sources, however, say that it would not be easy to get relief from the Centre, considering that the state decided against adopting the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. Punjab had opted out of PMFBY in 2016 (when the Akali-BJP was in power). Three years on, the state government is still considering on whether to come up with a crop insurance scheme or set up a crop compensation fund. Interestingly, Punjab Farmers and Farm Workers Commission had recommended that an insurance corporation be set up to compensate farmers for crop loss. They had recommended that farmers pay a levy of Re 1 per bag, with a matching levy to be paid by the state to create a corpus of Rs 250 crore each year (considering 2.50 crore bags of wheat and paddy reach mandis each year). The sources agree that on an average, Punjab has had to release Rs 100-150 crore crop damage compensation to farmers each year for the past seven years. In 2015, because of the whitefly attack on cotton, crop worth Rs 650 crore was damaged. Last year, too, Rs 100 crore was released for fields in Majha region getting submerged. “The only way to go forward would be to have a crop insurance scheme or a corpus to compensate farmers in case of loss of crop. A decision in favour of either of these options will have to be taken soon,” said a officer.

"Tribune News Service  New Delhi, October 3  Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday urged the Central Government to take up canalisation of the state’s three eastern rivers of the Indus water system as a national project, to enable conservation of water and enhancement of the region’s economic growth.  In his proposal presented to Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a meeting here, the Chief Minister suggested construction of high-speed economic corridors on 985 km long river embankments, apart from river training works, flood protection measures and lining of internal side-slopes of the Sutlej, Ravi and Beas. The move, Capt Amarinder said, would help the state enhance its ‘jal shakti’ (water power) to encourage diversification of agriculture, promote quality urbanisation and colonisation, and to speed up industrialisation for better and quicker economic emancipation of our citizens.    Complimenting the Prime Minister on his initiative to provide drinking water to each household in the country, through the creation of the new Ministry of Jal Shakti, and the inception of Jal (water) Jeevan (life) Mission and the “Nal se Jal” (tap water) scheme, Captain Amarinder said his government also stands committed to the cause of providing drinking water to its citizens under the initiative ‘Har Ghar Pani, Har Ghar Safai’ (water and sanitation for every household).  The Chief Minister, while expressing concern over the state’s reduction in ‘jal shakti’ at the time of India’s Partition and against during the reorganisation of the state in 1966, pointed out that the three perennial rivers of the Sutlej, Ravi and Beas irrigate only about 27 per cent of the state’s cultivated area, leading to over-exploitation of the ground water. It is apprehended, he further noted, that seven districts of the state will transform into a desert in the near future, with sure signs of poverty revisiting these areas.   Underlining the need to increase water productivity through augmentation and strengthening of water management, control and regulation infrastructure, Captain Amarinder suggested launch of the cannalisation project with the Sutlej river, which would require an investment of about Rs.4000 crore (US $ 0.7 billion) over a period of 3 to 5 years, exclusive of external incentives such as commercial exploitation of Government and private land and waiver of taxes, duties and cesses, as relevant. The task may begin with a feasibility study that may be assigned to techno-economic experts of international repute, he suggested.  The Chief Minister assured that the state would extend its full cooperation to get the proposal realised in terms of sending a team of officers from the Punjab Government to engage and discuss the same with the officials of the Union Ministry of Jal Shakti.   Captain Amarinder also underlined the need to harness the river water which was currently flowing into Pakistan during the monsoons. Pointing out that the three rivers as of now have kutcha (earthen) embankments, measuring 945.24 km; (Sutlej 484.12 km, Ravi 245.28 km and Beas 215.84 km), covering almost over 60 per cent of state’s area, he observed that the 1/3rd of the state’s population living in the riverfront areas was also suffering due to the flooding that occurs during the monsoon period. The canalisation of rivers and development of riverfront areas will expand activities leading to widening of the base of Punjab’s economy, diversifying economic activities and sources of livelihood for State’s rapidly growing younger generation, he added."
"Kulwinder Sandhu Tribune News Service Moga, September 22 A farmer of Talwandi Bhangeria village in Moga district has saved at least 62 lakh litres of water in his paddy fields in just two months. A team of the Jal Shakti Abhiyan, led by PK Mishra, Director, Financial Intelligence Unit of the Union Government, has inspected the fields of progressive farmer Baldev Singh, who has adopted the technique of sowing paddy directly, thus saving water. As per the information, Baldev had sown paddy on 7 acres with direct sowing technique and on another 7 acres with the traditional method of flooding the fields, on experimental basis. He installed meters on the pumps irrigating the fields to calculate the usage.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Dr Jaswinder Singh Brar, Plant Protection Officer, who accompanied the team, said when they compared water usage after two months, the team found that the farmer had saved at least 62 lakh litres of water by using the new technique. The farmer told the visiting team that he was practicing the technique for the past couple of years and had saved water as well as power worth around Rs 1,100 per acre. Brar said the paddy fields with direct sowing method require irrigation once a week while those with traditional methods require irrigation two times a week. Many studies claim that directly seeding rice into fields than transplanting it into flooded fields also reduces methane emissions and slows down climate change, he added. Director PK Mishra commended the farmer for his exemplary work and appealed to farmers to do away with traditional technique and instead sow paddy directly to save maximum water, which is the need of the hour. Change technique to save power, water  Pertinently, 41.58 lakh hectares in Punjab is under cultivation. Of which, irrigation with the help of 14 lakh tubewells is done on 29.54 lakh hectares while canal water is used to irrigate just 11.16 lakh hectares If Baldev's claims are to be believed, Punjab could save Rs 770 crore on power by sowing paddy directly on 28 lakh hectares. These figures can be increased by bringing more area under canal irrigation and adopting rain harvesting practices The Central Groundwater Commission has already declared 116 of the total 138 revenue blocks in the state as “dark zones” for over exploitation of groundwater "
"Anirudh Gupta Ferozepur, September 9 Following rise in the Sutlej level and subsequent flooding of areas along the border in this sector, Pakistan-based drug peddlers have been trying to push consignments inside the Indian territory through the “vulnerable” riverine gaps where fencing could not be erected. On Monday morning, the alert BSF troops of 136 Battalion thwarted the third consecutive attempt to smuggle heroin inside India through the Sutlej taking advantage of water hyacinth in the river. The BSF men seized five packets of heroin from an area near the Shameke border outpost, which was being pushed through the water channel. Since the Sutlej zigzags along the border in this sector, Pakistani smugglers try to exploit these riverine gaps to execute their sinister designs, said an official.

The very next day floods washed away everything along with savings her parents had kept for the marriage. Her family in Mundi Cholian village had planned to do marriage within a month but now they are left with no other option but to postpone it. This is the sad tale of the families who had saved for their daughter’s marriages throughout their lives and now that everything has gone, the families are in a dilemma whether they should gather themselves first or think of marriage.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); New permutations and combinations have started taking shape.

Our kutcha house has developed cracks. There is knee-deep water in the house,” the worried mother said. Harmesh Singh of the same village is also disturbed. Marriage of his 20-year-old sister Kirpal Kaur (name changed) is due next month. He had bought a washing machine and a bed for her marriage which are now redundant.

"Ruchika M Khanna Tribune News Service Chandigarh, August 31 The calamity that struck Punjab on August 18, when heavy downpour led to rise in water level of the Sutlej and Beas, could have been averted to a large extent. The encroachments on riverbeds and along the banks of the Sutlej, large-scale mining of sand and inability of the government in clearing crops, poplar tree plantations and wild growth from riverbeds collectively led to the massive flooding in six districts. Admitting that there have been lapses by the successive state governments, the Capt Amarinder Singh government is now willing to right the wrongs, and avoid such disasters in future. Though the Sutlej and Beas were in spate following a heavy downpour, had the successive governments kept tabs on the said violations, it is likely that the damage and flooding would not have been as massive as witnessed now.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Wherever the ownership of dried-up riverbeds is in private hands, farmers have gone for poplar plantation or grown crops. And the tracts of land where ownership rests with the government, the drainage wing of the Department of Water Resources, working on a skeletal budget, failed to clear the wild vegetation. The Northern India Canal and Drainage Act, meant to regulate irrigation, navigation and drainage, is clear that even at places where ownership is in private hands, the government has the power to prohibit and remove obstructions in the natural flow of water and recover the cost from the owner. Government officials agree that the Act has barely been put to use in recent past, leading to tree plantations and overgrowth of vegetation in river beds, that obstructed the gushing waters and led to flooding along embankments. Official sources have told The Tribune that the state government had allocated Rs 100 crore to the drainage wing for this year, of which over Rs 30 crore was spent for relining the river banks and a similar amount for cleaning the drains.  Since the project of Rs 418 crore to clear the riverbeds of encroachments and for flood management programme in the two rivers, is pending with the Central Water Commission (CWC), the state had no resources. Trees and wild growth obstructed the flow of water in the Sutlej, where not just BBMB released water to protect the dam, but water flowing in from the Swan (89,000 cusecs) and Siswan (65,000 cusecs) rivers, too led to the overflowing of the river. Officials admit that another major reason behind flooding was mining. Illegal miners seem to have weakened dhussi bundhs. The BBMB authorities have often said mining was a serious issue. Even World Bank had earlier refused to fund a project for channelising the seasonal rivulets that flow into the Sutlej because of mining (legal and illegal). At many places, large tracts of riverbeds have been encroached by squatters as well as colonisers. Over 1.47 lakh acres of the Sutlej floodplain (land adjacent to the river) has been encroached upon. Sources say that the Sutlej river, as it meanders downstream thins to a width of just 20 ft from 100 ft as it nears Ropar, especially near the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT). With illegal construction remaining unchecked for decades, this too contributed to flooding as unprecedented discharge of water was witnessed. Survey begins in Phillaur, Shahkot  The Jalandhar administration has started the process to conduct girdawari in flood-hit villages to assess the loss suffered by farmers and locals. Teams of revenue officers have started the process in Phillaur and Shahkot subdivisions. DC Varinder Kumar Sharma said as per preliminary report, crops in 82 villages in the district had been destroyed due to floods. He said of these, 52 villages were in Shahkot and 30 in Phillaur. oc "

The meeting lasted for close to two hours during which various technical aspects pertaining to the corridor were discussed, Chief Engineer with NHAI, T S Chahal, said. Officials of the Ministry of Home Affairs, BSF, Land Port Authority of India, which is constructing a state-of-the-art passenger terminal building, also attended the meeting. The corridor will connect Darbar Sahib in Pakistan’s Kartarpur with Dera Baba Nanak shrine in Gurdaspur district and facilitate visa-free movement of Indian Sikh pilgrims, who will have to just obtain a permit to visit Kartarpur Sahib, which was established in 1522 by Sikh faith founder Guru Nanak Dev.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); This was the first meeting on the Kartarpur Corridor after India on August 5 revoked Article 370 of the Constitution, which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir, and bifurcated the state into two Union Territories. Chahal said the technical issues regarding the level of roads and the bridge of proposed corridor, were also discussed. Medical facilities which would be provided to pilgrims during their visit were also discussed. In the meeting, which was held in makeshift tents at the Zero Point, both sides discussed timing of completion of the bridge, alignment of the roads and other engineering aspects of the proposed crossing points. “The meeting was held in a cordial atmosphere,” said Chahal. He said various works relating to the corridor would be completed well in time before the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak in November. So far, there is no official word from the Pakistani side on Friday’s meeting. The area where the meeting took place was heavily guarded and no media personnel was allowed to go near the venue. However, the devotees and local people were allowed access to a point on the Indian side from where they could see Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib. Pakistan and India have been discussing the modalities regarding the opening of the corridor at Narowal, some 125 km from Lahore, on the occasion of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak in November. Over the past few months, many rounds of meetings have been held on the corridor during which the experts from the two sides have discussed its alignment, coordinates and other engineering aspects of the proposed crossing points. In July, delegations of the two countries held a meeting on the Pakistani side of the Attari-Wagah border to discuss the modalities of the Kartarpur Corridor, which will also be the first visa-free corridor between the two neighbours since their independence in 1947. Pakistan is building the corridor from the Indian border to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, the final resting place of Guru Nanak, while the other part from Dera Baba Nanak up to the border will be constructed by India. India is constructing a bridge at the Zero Point and has urged Pakistan to build a similar bridge on its side that will provide safe and secure movement of pilgrims and address concerns regarding flooding. The bridge is over a creek of which the majority part falls in Pakistan. Tension between India and Pakistan has escalated after New Delhi revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s special status. Reacting to India’s move on Kashmir, Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled the Indian High Commissioner. PTI"
"Deepkamal Kaur Tribune News Service Jalandhar, August 28 Over the years, crores have been spent on irrigation and flood control on the 1,400-km dhussi bundh in the state. Around Rs 22.66 crore has been sanctioned for this fiscal too. But after witnessing last week’s flood havoc across Jalandhar alone, it now seems that either the funds were less or these were improperly utilised as the Sutlej banks unexpectedly gave way at 18 points, leading to the worst-ever disaster. As many as 21 villages remained flooded in Phillaur and Shahkot subdivisions for nearly a week with huge losses incurred by all departments, including the PSPCL, Railways, School Education and Agriculture. Even though the final estimates for the repair work of the bundhs are yet to be prepared but it is learnt that all big and small breaches would require at least Rs 10 crore. Though the villagers have been venting their ire against the Drainage Department for their alleged laxity, the officials are not ready to accept any fault at their end.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); “What could have we done when nearly 2.75 lakh cusecs of water came flowing from the Bhakra and its tributaries in one go? Our bundhs have been designed only to bear water up to the capacity of 2 lakh cusecs. Water at some places was flowing over the berms. Had the bundhs not been strong enough, there could have been 500-600 breaches going by the amount of water that suddenly flowed in,” said Chief Engineer, Drainage, Sanjiv Gupta. A junior engineer said, “The Jalandhar circle that includes embankments falling in five districts (Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Nawanshahr, Ludhiana and Hoshiarpur) got only Rs 4-5 lakh. The most affected Lohian-Shahkot area, which falls in the 45-km section, got just Rs 30 lakh. This amount gets used up in cleaning just 15 km of drains.” Talking about the reasons for Lohian villages bearing the maximum brunt, drainage officials said, “This area forms a deadlock with gates at Harike lying shut. There was no way for water to go beyond. So, the water got collected here, which just kept on spreading, flooding more villages each day.” DC Varinder Kumar Sharma said, “I do not want to get into the debate on the working of the Drainage Department. I am more concerned about getting all breaches plugged. All breaches in Phillaur have been filled. We’ve got access to four-five breaches in Lohian beyond Janian Chahal village. We have taken permission to carry sandbags across the Gidderpindi track between 7 am and 7 pm.”"

"Ruchika M Khanna Tribune News Service Chandigarh, August 25 The damage caused in Punjab by floods, mainly on account of water being released through spillways of the Bhakra Dam, was immense and needed special assistance from the Centre, in addition to the relief that was being provided through the Disaster Relief Management Fund, the state government has said. Though the Union Government initially asked Punjab to provide relief from the disaster fund of Rs 6,200 crore lying with the state, Punjab has been insisting on a special package of Rs 1,000 crore to rebuild infrastructure, a senior government official said. Punjab has reasoned that the relief fund could not be used for rebuilding infrastructure.

The Centre has listed 11 states for IMCT review of the flood damage but Punjab does not find mention in it, even though the state has witnessed large-scale flooding in many areas following unprecedented rains.  The chief minister urged Home Minister Amit Shah to immediately rectify it.  ""Surprised on the exclusion of Punjab from the list of states to be visited by the Inter-Ministerial Central Team to assess losses in flood-affected areas in different states. Request HM @AmitShah ji to direct the central team to visit Punjab to assess the huge losses,"" Singh tweeted.

The IMCT has been mandated to visit Meghalaya, Assam, Tripura, Bihar, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala to make final recommendations to the Centre for allocation of flood assistance to the flood-ravaged states.  Singh said he had already written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking a special flood relief package of Rs 1,000 crore for compensating the losses resulting from floods in the state.  It is estimated, as per initial calculations, that the state has suffered damage worth Rs 1,700 crore.  Singh, who was extensively touring the affected areas, had also urged the prime minister to instruct authorities to waive crop loans availed by affected farmers from banks/financial institutions during the current cropping season.  Recent rains and release of excess water from Bhakra dam to Sutlej river had caused extensive damage to standing crops and had inundated residential areas in several districts including Jalandhar, Kpaurthala, Ludhiana, Ferozepur, Rupnagar and Kapurthala.  Meanwhile, Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, Balbir Singh Sidhu, Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria, Gurpreet Singh Kangar, Bharat Bhushan Ashu and Punjab Assembly Speaker Rana K P Singh spent the day overseeing the relief and rescue operations in Doaba and Malwa.

"Anirudh Gupta Ferozepur, August 22 With hostile neighbour (Pakistan) on one side and the ravaging Sutlej on the other, farmers residing in villages along the India-Pakistan border here are seemingly caught between the proverbial “devil and the deep sea”. Not only the hostilities between the two countries have a direct bearing on their well-being, the Sutlej too plays havoc with their lives almost every year. Scores of villages, including Tindiwala, Kaluwala, Chandiwala, Kassoke, Kamalewala, Khunder Gatti, situated between the zero line and right flank of dhussi “bundh” face this nightmare of floods almost every year. In 1988 and 2006 these villages were totally submerged. Even during normal days, the only mode of transportation available for some of these villages is wooden “bera” (indigenously built boat), which ferries them to the mainland. However, when the river is in spate, they remain trapped inside their “kutcha” houses as even the “bera” no longer remains safe. “Almost every second year, the river water inundates our dwellings,” Mangal Singh of Chinniwala village said, adding that his fields had been wrecked by the Sutlej thrice in the past five years. Echoing similar sentiment, Darshan Singh said: “Every year, the same story is repeated but nothing has changed on ground.” Shingar Singh said: “What to talk of floods, we otherwise also don’t have access to basic amenities such as education, healthcare, potable water, sewerage or proper roads. We have got used to even floods now.”(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Kulwinder Singh said: “Even the claim of compensation is a farce. After running from pillar to post, we got meagre compensation for the damage caused to our crops. But even those cheques bounced when deposited in banks.” Chanan Singh said: “Even when it comes to personal matters like getting the right matrimonial alliance for prospective brides and grooms, we are the suffering lot. People from other parts of the state are never willing to get their sons or daughters married in our villages due to the fear of either floods or war.” “Now, we have started losing hope. Frequent flooding of our fields has shattered our financial condition,” said Maggar, adding: “Working in fields under hawk’s eye of gun-totting BSF sleuths, we do not have enough resources or skills to go and settle elsewhere but do not want our children to settle here now.” “The government had promised to transfer the land in our name but nothing has been done yet,” said Desha Singh."
"Ruchika M Khanna Tribune News Service Chandigarh, August 21 Even as the state remained on the edge, with almost 75,000 cusecs water being released by the BBMB, the government is grappling with the issue of compensating farmers, who have suffered losses worth crores. The government has been dilly-dallying on formulating a crop insurance policy, which could have been useful to compensate farmers whose losses are now estimated at Rs 750 crore. In such a situation, the relief that the state can offer is just Rs 12,200 per hectare (or Rs 5,083.33 per acre) from the State Disaster Relief Management Fund, unless the Centre recognises flooding in Punjab as a natural disaster and gives it a flood relief package.  It is only then the cash-strapped state can look at a more decent compensation to be awarded to farmers. At places, where the farmers have suffered a loss of more than one crop (in Fazilka- Abohar, where besides horticulture crops, cotton is grown), Rs 5,625 per acre would be given for loss of horticulture crops and Rs 5,083.33 per acre for other crops sown along with kinnows. Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh today wrote to the Prime Minister, seeking a Rs 1,000-crore special package, besides asking him to instruct the authorities to waive crop loans taken by farmers in affected villages for the current cropping season. The flooding in the Sutlej due to discharge of water from Bhakra Dam has caused extensive damage to crops, inundating 326 villages of Ropar, Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Moga, Ferozepur and Kapurthala. It is estimated that crop on 1.20 lakh acres of cultivated area is submerged.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Official sources, however, say that it would not be easy to get relief from the Centre, considering that the state decided against adopting the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. Punjab had opted out of PMFBY in 2016 (when the Akali-BJP was in power). Three years on, the state government is still considering on whether to come up with a crop insurance scheme or set up a crop compensation fund. Interestingly, Punjab Farmers and Farm Workers Commission had recommended that an insurance corporation be set up to compensate farmers for crop loss. They had recommended that farmers pay a levy of Re 1 per bag, with a matching levy to be paid by the state to create a corpus of Rs 250 crore each year (considering 2.50 crore bags of wheat and paddy reach mandis each year). The sources agree that on an average, Punjab has had to release Rs 100-150 crore crop damage compensation to farmers each year for the past seven years. In 2015, because of the whitefly attack on cotton, crop worth Rs 650 crore was damaged. Last year, too, Rs 100 crore was released for fields in Majha region getting submerged. “The only way to go forward would be to have a crop insurance scheme or a corpus to compensate farmers in case of loss of crop. A decision in favour of either of these options will have to be taken soon,” said a officer.

"Vijay Mohan Tribune News Service Chandigarh, August 19 With water in rivulets that merge into the Sutlej downstream of the Bhakra Dam subsiding and level in the dam’s reservoir exceeding its permissible limit, authorities at the Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) have decided to increase the quantum of excess water being discharged from the dam. While the BBMB had restricted the discharge to 18,000 to 20,000 cusecs through the sluice gates at the top of the dam over the past three days, it will now discharge an additional 20,000 cusecs over the next few days to maintain the water level within the permissible limit and maintain a buffer for continuous inflows. Besides, an outflow of 36,000 is through the power generation tunnels. The water level this morning was 1,681 feet against the permissible limit of 1,680 feet. With an inflow of 91,000 cusecs, BBMB officials estimate the level to touch 1,683 feet by late night. Inflow had peaked to 3.11 lakh cusecs on August 18. “Despite heavy inflows into the reservoir, we had earlier limited the release of water from Bhakra because heavy rains in the region had generated more than two lakh cusecs in rivulets like Sirsa, Swan and Lohand, which lie between Bhakra and Ropar,” a BBMB official said.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); “Since there is no forecast of any significant rain over the next seven days, we can now release the excess water in a regulated manner,” he added. The dam’s filling season lasts till September 30 when monsoon and snowmelt recede and inflows drop. Unforeseen weather events that can bring in deluge also have to be factored in. Within a span of a year, the dam has witnessed extremities, from being virtually empty last summer with a storage reduced to just seven per cent due to historically low inflows to now managing surplus supply. BBMB officials said of the 2.40 lakh cusecs that passed downstream of Ropar, only 19,000 cusecs had been released from sluice gates.

"Tribune News Service Sangrur/Patiala, July 23 Blaming the Akalis for the control of the Ghaggar river going to  the Central Water Commission (CWC), Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh  on Tuesday said he would meet central ministers and officials to press  for reinforcement of the embankments of the river, which had breached  causing serious damage to standing crop and other assets in Sangrur and  Patiala. The division of Punjab by the Akalis in 1966 had led to Punjab’s  Ghaggar going into the hands of the CWC, causing the state to lose  control over the critical maintenance of its embankments, the CM said,  adding that the Akalis had even stopped the river reinforcement work  undertaken by him in his previous term. His government in the last term had completed 22 km of reinforcement  of the embankments, after which work was suspended by the previous  SAD-BJP government, he added. Calling upon Haryana to join hands to resolve the issue, the CM said  the bandhs of the Ghaggar on both Punjab and Haryana sides need to be  strengthened and made motorable, wherever possible, to avoid repeat of  the floods, and the attendant losses and misery. Pointing out that Punjab had submitted its proposal before the CWC  for taming the Ghaggar six years ago, the CM said the CWC in March 2019  had ordered a feasibility study by an independent agency like Central  Water and Power Research Station, Pune.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); He said he would ask the Centre to direct the CWC to give the  necessary clearance expeditiously to allow Punjab to undertake Phase 2  of the project from Makror Sahib to Karail (17.5 km). Amarinder was speaking with farmers and media at Moonak in Sangrur  and Badshahpur in Patiala after taking an aerial view to assess the  damage caused as a result of the flooding caused by a breach in the  Ghaggar river catchment area, following torrential rains. The CM, who flew over Rajpura, Ghanaur and Shutrana before stopping  over at Moonak, said about 50,000 acres of crop had been lost in Patiala  and another 10,000 acres in Sangrur due to the breach. Amarinder said he had been seeing the problem since his childhood in  Moonak, which he described as his ‘nanihal’, underlined the need to  reinforce the bandhs to prevent flooding and damage. A special girdawari is under way to assess the crop damage and would  be complete as soon as the water receded, the CM said, promising  adequate compensation against all losses. The compensation, he said,  would be released the day he received the report on the girdawari. The Ghaggar was creating problems even in Bathinda, where even the  police lines were under water, said Amarinder, adding that the district  had received the highest rainfall in 40 years, causing the water to flow  at very high levels. In Moonak, the CM ordered the DC to pay immediate compensation to the  28 houses damaged, three of them completely, as a result of the  flooding. He directed the officials to send the fire brigade and JCB  machines today itself to raise the roads, and also instructed the Mandi  Board to commence work without delay. The CM assured the people that his government had adequate disaster  relief funds to tackle the situation. The local administration, the  Army, the National Disaster Relief Force and the locals had been working  hard round the clock to plug the canal breach, he said. Later, expressing sorrow at the loss of crops in Badshahpur,  Amarinder said he felt saddened to see the damage in Patiala villages,  which he had been visiting since he was a child. Fortunately, there was  no loss of human life or cattle, said Amarinder, adding that a few  people had been injured and were being provided treatment by the  government. He assured construction of 33 kucha houses that had been  damaged in the flooding. The CM thanked the 1st Armoured Division of the Army based in Patiala  for the help extended to the district administration in providing  relief to the people. Amarinder also announced Rs 60 lakh for rebuilding the bridge that  had been damaged at Sirkapda village of Ghanaur. He also acceded to the  request that the mandi at Badshahpur be made pucca before the arrival of  the next crop. Usually flooding took place in these areas in September, but with the  weather patterns changing, it was becoming difficult to make any  predictions, the CM said, warning that though water had receded for now,  it was important to be prepared for any eventuality. Earlier, Shutrana MLA Nirmal Singh apprised the CM of the extent of  damage to crops and property in the villages of the Assembly  constituency due to the breach."
"Tribune News Service Sangrur, July 22 Days after a breach in the Ghaggar flooded many villages in the district, the authorities could only manage to plug three-fourths of the 100 ft breach. As per the latest report, the overflowing Ghaggar has affected standing crop on 21,775 acres. Of this, crop on 15,569 acres was affected due to the breach in the river in the last five days. Deputy Commissioner Ghanshyam Thori said, “The lack of required passage till the breach has delayed the operation. The water level in the Ghaggar has come down to 745.01 today, while we have plugged around 75-ft breach with only about 25 ft gap is left to be filled.” The flooding has affected crops such as paddy, vegetables, cotton, maize and fodder over 7,392 acres in Moonak, 920 Bhundar Bhaini, 567 Surjan Bhaini, 1,883 Salegarh and 1,622 Phullad village. Apart from Ghaggar, rain has also affected 6206 acres of standing crops in Lehragaga, Andana,Sunam, Dhuri and Sangrur blocks.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Senior officials of the Agriculture Department said after remaining waterlogged for five day, the chances of survival of various crops were dim as even after plugging of the breach, the Drainage Department would not be able to dewater the fields immediately. SGPC chief Gobind Singh Longowal, said, “We have offered land in Dhamtan Sahib and Nankiana Sahib to be used to grow paddy saplings for the affected farmers.”"
"Rajmeet Singh Tribune News Service Chandigarh, July 21 The state government has blamed Haryana for the damage caused in Patiala and Sangrur districts due to the overflowing Ghaggar. The state has pointed out that timely channelisation of the 17.5-km stretch from Makror Sahib to Karail by the Punjab’s Drainage Department could have saved marooning of several areas along Ghaggar’s embankments, but Haryana did not allow it. Sensing gravity of the situation and loss suffered by farmers, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh has decided to take up the issue with the Centre. “The misery of the people due to flooding needs to be addressed at the earliest, rising above political differences on water sharing,” said a senior official in the CMO.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The state’s Drainage Department has requested the Central Water Commission (CWC) to depute its officials to visit the affected areas to get first-hand information on the necessity to undertake the pending channelisation work. Chief Engineer (Drainage) Sanjeev Gupta said, “I have requested the CWC to visit the flooded areas. This would allow us to explain the need to carry out channelisation as per the recommendations of the study conducted by Irrigation and Power Institute, Amritsar.” The state has sought strengthening of the embankments raised by villagers from Makror Sahib to Karail. The damage to villages due to swollen Ghaggar has once again brought to the fore the tussle between Punjab and Haryana over water sharing. While Haryana wants release of water in the Hansi-Butana canal, it is notletting the Punjab Government channelise the Ghaggar near Khanauri on the interstate border. The river had caused huge damage in Patiala, Sangrur and Mansa districts in 1988, 2010 and 2015. This year too, the river has been in spate due to incessant rains, creating havoc in numerous villages. What is neighbouring state’s objection?  The work of constructing 22.45-km embankments on both sides of the river was completed in 2009 under phase-1 of channelisation from Khanauri to Makror Sahib.  Haryana raised objection before the Central Water Commission (CWC) over the phase 2 from Khanauri to Karail, stating that further channelisation will endanger its villages. After villagers of Moonak belt filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court seeing continuation of the work, the matter was referred to the CWC.  After six years, the CWC conducted a meeting of the Ghaggar standing committee in March and directed to carry out a model study of Ghaggar basin by an independent agency to settle the dispute.

As per an estimate prepared by the Agriculture Department, 18,951 acres under paddy crop and 3,951 acres under cotton crop are presently waterlogged. Further, the farmers said by the time their fields would be de-watered, they would not be left with time to sow the crop again. Meanwhile, Gurpreet Singh, Agriculture Officer, Muktsar, said “If the paddy fields remain waterlogged for three-four days, then the crop gets devastated. Presently, rainwater is draining out fast from the fields and if the fields are de-watered in the next few days, farmers will be able to sow basmati crop again. The basmati sowing season will last till the end of this month.” He further said the area under cotton crop was not much affected as cotton growers had not planted the crop in low-lying areas.

"Tribune News Service Sanghera (Moga), July 16  Hundreds of acres of standing paddy crop and green fodder have been submerged in water in many villages/settlements located inside the dhusi bundh of the Sutlej in Dharamkot subdivision of the district as the water level in the river has increased due to moderate and heavy rainfall in its catchment areas during the past 24 hours. Sarpanch of Sanghera village Balkar Singh claimed that paddy, green fodder and mint crops were damaged on more than 1,500 acres of land inside the dhusi bundh in at least six villages and human settlements. A vast stretch of cultivable fields are located inside the bundh. Many link roads were seen submerged in water. There was also shortage of potable water, local people alleged. Sanghera village and a few human settlements have been completely disconnected from other areas due to flooding. Several houses and tubewells have also submerged. Meanwhile, Narinder Singh Dhaliwal, Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Dharamkot, claimed that he had visited the areas around the dhusi bundh along with officials of the Agriculture Department.

"Kulwinder Sandhu Tribune News Service Moga, July 14 Pushing for sustainable agriculture practices, the Union Government is carrying out a study with the help of the state Agriculture Department in Moga and its adjoining districts to substantiate the worth of directly sowing paddy without puddling the fields. Various studies conducted across the world, particularly in the South-Asian countries, claim that direct sowing of paddy without puddling the fields reduce methane gas emission, preserve groundwater and save power. Though a debate is on in Punjab for many years to reduce paddy cultivation due to depleting groundwater, air pollution due to stubble burning and huge consumption of power, farmers are unwilling to switch to other crops. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });The study by the new Union Ministry of Jal Shakti is aimed at preserving the natural resources and save Punjab from turning into a “desert”. A team of Jal Shakti headed by its Deputy Secretary VK Paul visited Talwandi Bhangerian village in Moga and inspected the fields of progressive farmer Baldev Singh who had directly sown paddy. He has sown paddy on seven acres with this technique and seven acres with the traditional practice of flooding the fields with water. The visiting team in association with the state Agriculture Department has installed meters on water pumps irrigating both paddy fields for comparative study on water consumed. The Central team will also monitor the power consumed in both fields. The farmer told the visiting team that he was practicing the new technique for the past couple of years and has found that he saved around Rs 1,100 per acre on power consumption, which comes out to Rs 2,750 per hectare. Jaswinder Singh Brar, Plant Protection Officer of Moga district, who accompanied the Central team, said 41.58 lakh hectares in Punjab was under cultivation of various crops. Of which, irrigation with the help of 14-lakh tubewells was done on 29.54 lakh hectares while canal water was used on just 11.16 lakh hectares. “Going by the claims of this Moga farmer, Punjab could save Rs 770 crore on powerpower by directly sowing paddy on 28 lakh hectares. These figures can be increased by bringing more area under canal irrigation and adopting rain harvesting practices,” said Dinesh Dhawan, Deputy Adviser of Niti Aayog, who also accompanied the team. It acquires significance because the Central Groundwater Commission has already declared 116 of the total 138 revenue blocks in the state as “dark zones” for over exploitation of groundwater. The paddy fields with direct sowing method requires irrigation once a week as compared to two irrigation in the traditional method of transplanting the seedlings. As such, 50 per cent of water could be saved by adopting this new technique, which is the need of the hour. Brar says many studies claim that directly seeding rice into fields than transplanting it into flooded fields reduces methane emissions and slow down climate change. "
"Varinder Singh Tribune News Service Jalandhar, July 13 Conceding to India’s demand, the Imran Khan-led Pakistan government has removed Khalistani supporter Gopal Singh Chawla from the top position of the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) just a day before the crucial July 14 technical level talks to sort out and finalise nitty-gritty of the Kartarpur corridor. India has been raising its objections and concerns over inclusion of ‘anti-India’ and Pakistan-based ‘Khalistan supporters in religious bodies of Sikhs in Pakistan’. It was also said to have been conveyed by India in clear terms that continuation of such radical leaders would cast its dark shadow in operationalistation of the Kartarpur Sahib corridor. As Pakistan has re-constituted the PSGPC, the other pro-Khalistani leaders who no longer figure in the new list were: Tara Singh, Bisan Singh, Kuljit Singh and Maninder Singh. The main objection of India has been that Gopal Singh Chawla was known to be a close aide of Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) chief Hafiz Sayeed and that he has been ‘misuing’ the Pakistan gurdwaras’ premises for propogation of anti-India sentiments. Chawla had came to limelight last year and had stirred a wave of anger across India when he had stopped Indian officials from visiting a Lahore-based gurdwara to meet Indian Sikh pilgrims converged there. His name had popped up in the investigation into a grenade attack at Nirankari Bhawan in Amritsar in November last wherein three people were killed. His photographs with terrorist Hafiz Saeed had surfaced in media.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The Imran-led Pakistan government had apparently sensed that the sensitive issue of pro-Khalistanis active in Pakistan could surface in the July 14 crucial meeting and that it could even hamper the talks which have been going on smoothly so far. India had not only asked for clarification as to why they (Chawla and others) have been included in the Kartarpur committee but it had also made it clear to Pak that it was ready to go ahead with the corridor but without any let up on the country’s security concerns. Earlier, second round of talks scheduled to be held on April 2 were kept in abeyance after Khalistani elements were inducted in Pakistan’s Kartarpur corridor committee. With the removal of Chawla and other Khalistanis from the PSGPC, one major impediment has been removed. But both sides would have to a long way to go to make the corridor operarional for Sikh pilgrims at the earlier and also to celebrate Guru Nanak’s  550th birth anniversary jointly in November this year. The two sides are yet to hammer out a consensus on certain major issues, including the mode of connectivity. India wants a bridge over the seasonal flooding prone creek leading to Kartarpur but, Pakistan was insisting upon a causeway. The other major issue to crop up tomorrow was the quantum of passengers to be allowed to go to the shrine on a daily basis. While Pakistan has been saying it was ready to handle just 700 pilgrims, India was persisting that 5,000 pilgrims should be allowed daily. Kartarpur corridor was first mooted in 1999 by then Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and subsequently the foundation stone of the corridor was laid on Pakistan side on November 26, 2018. India and Pakistan were keen to finish the corridor work at the earliest to make the event coincide with the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev in November 2019. Upon completion, the corridor will connect Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan’s Kartarpur with Dera Baba Nanak shrine in Gurdaspur district in India. The completion of the corridor will facilitate visa-free movement of Indian Sikh pilgrims. The pilgrims will require just a permit to visit Kartarpur Sahib --- established in 1522 by the faith’s founder Guru Nanak Dev."

"New Delhi, July 11 The External Affairs Ministry said on Thursday India was fully committed to the Kartarpur Sahib corridor project and wanted the work to be completed expeditiously.    The assertion came after a section of media reported that India is lagging behind in the construction of the Kartarpur corridor. ""We are fully committed to this project and want it to be expeditiously completed,"" Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said at the weekly media briefing. He said the government is aware of the sentiments of people and pilgrims for the Kartarpur Sahib. Kumar said the work on two important aspects— the state of the art passenger terminal and the four-lane highway which is going to connect the zero point of the Kartarpur corridor to the national highway—will be completed in time.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); ""One (should be completed) by September 2019 and the other by October 2019.

The first meeting to finalise the modalities for the corridor took place on the Indian side of the Attari-Wagah border on March 14. A meeting will be held on the Pakistan side of the Wagah border on July 14. ""Our desire to have talks basically conveys that whatever the differences are, we will have talks and we will take up those matters with Pakistan when we meet them up on 14th of this month,"" Kumar added.   India had earlier conveyed its strong concerns to Pakistan over the presence of a leading Khalistani separatist in a committee appointed by Islamabad on the Kartarpur project. Issues related to providing facilities to pilgrims, including allowing a larger number of pilgrims to move across the corridor, and other modalities for the project will be further discussed at a meeting on July 14, sources said here. Three rounds of technical level discussions have been held with the Pakistani side and they have been asked not to create structures that will, in any manner, endanger life and property on the Indian side due to flooding, the sources said. India is already building a bridge on its side to provide all-weather connectivity for the Kartarpur corridor, they said. Pakistan has also been urged to build a similar bridge on their side that will provide safe and secure movement of the pilgrims and also address concerns regarding flooding, according to the sources. The passenger terminal building is being constructed by the Land Ports Authority of India. The work for it was awarded to the Shapoorji Pallonji Group on May 29. The land acquisition process has been completed with the support of the Punjab government and the project is scheduled to be completed by October 31. The total cost of the project is Rs 177.5 crore. The four-lane highway connecting the 'zero point' of the Kartarpur corridor up to National Highway-354 is being constructed by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), the sources said. In November 2018, Pakistan agreed to set up the border-crossing linking Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur, the final resting place of Sikh faith founder Guru Nanak, to Dera Baba Nanak in Punjab's Gurdaspur district. Kartarpur is located in Pakistan's Narowal district across the Ravi river, about 4 km from Dera Baba Nanak. Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu and Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had, on November 26 last year, laid the foundation stone of the Kartarpur corridor in Gurdaspur district. Two days later, the Pakistani prime minister laid the foundation stone of the corridor in Narowal, around 125 km from Lahore. PTI"
"Jupinderjit Singh Tribune News Service Chandigarh, July 8 Accusing the Akalis of trying to divide Sikhs on party lines by organising parallel functions of 550th anniversary celebrations of Guru Nanak, Cooperation and Jails Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, who is head of Kartarpur Development Project, claimed that Pakistan had completed more than 70 per cent of work, while India was still lagging behind with just about 30 per cent completion. In an interview with The Tribune, Randhawa said the SAD and the BJP-led Central government were trying to spoil the work done by Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on the project as well as organising celebration functions jointly with the SGPC under the aegis of Akal Takht. He took on SAD president Sukhbir Badal for recently accusing Pakistan of trying to delay the project. “We had met Akal Takht Jathedar and the SGPC management requesting them to organise joint celebrations. The SGPC and the government had issued a joint statement to this effect also, but Sukhbir took a delegation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to invite him without taking the state government into confidence. It is sad that politicians are trying to score political brownie points over the pious occasion,” he said.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Officials from India and Pakistan are meeting on July 14 to discuss the modalities of the project.  “We want to take people of all faiths along in the celebrations, but we are saddened by the politics being played over the issue. No special provision was made in the Union Budget despite demand by the Punjab government,” the minister said. Randhawa said his government too had some concerns with Pakistan but these were of constructive nature. “We are demanding that the visa fee for visit to Nankana Sahib, which is Rs 3,100 at present, be reduced. We also want the number of visitors to be at least 5,000 instead of 700 limit announced by Pakistan,” he said. There was also an issue about flooding of Dera Baba Nanak due to construction on Pakistan side for the Kartarpur corridor. “The water of Ujh river in Pakistan might be diverted to India and flood Dera Baba Nanak in case of heavy rains. We have taken precautionary measures by strengthening the bandh on our side. We want Pakistan to take equal measures. We hope the Indian officials will raise this issue in July 14 meeting,” Randhawa added. About the project  In November 2018, India and Pakistan agreed to set up a corridor linking Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan’s Kartarpur, the final resting place of Guru Nanak Dev, to Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur. The corridor is expected to provide visa-free access to Sikh pilgrims to the gurdwara in Kartarpur Sahib, a small town in Narowal, 4 km from the Indo-Pak border, where Guru Nanak spent the last 18 years of his life.  Takht for joint Gurpurb celebrations  Amritsar: Akal Takht acting Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh has directed the Sant Samaj and Sikh organisations to celebrate the 550th anniversary of Guru Nanak unitedly. He told the SGPC to appoint two senior members to coordinate between various groups and invite all for the occasion. Representatives of various Sikh organisations, including Sant Samaj, led by Damdami Taksal head Harnam Singh Khalsa, had a meeting with the Jathedar at the Akal Takht secretariat on Monday. "
"Ravi Dhaliwal Tribune News Service Gurdaspur, July 4 The Pakistan government’s insistence on constructing a causeway, instead of a bridge, on its side as a part of the Kartarpur corridor project may indefinitely push back the October 31 deadline to complete the project. The Pakistan government wants to build a 300-m-long causeway over a low-lying area till the border which, in turn, will join the 100-m-long bridge being constructed by India. Officials of the NHAI and Ceigall India Limited, the company contracted to build the corridor, have objected to Pakistan’s proposal saying huge part of the corridor in the Indian territory may see heavy flooding of the Ravi, if a causeway was built. A causeway refers to a roadway which does not allow nautical navigation underneath it while a bridge does. Jeetendra Singh, vice president of the firm, said there was every possibility that flood water would be diverted to the Indian side if a causeway was built.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); “We are at a lower gradient with respect to the Ravi floodplains in Pakistan. So when the Ravi is in spate, the water will flow towards us. A bridge will mean the water will drain out, while a causeway will not allow the drainage. We had told Pakistani officials right at the start that we need to build a bridge adhering to international norms. We have flagged our concerns multiple times, but they have been saying they can only make a causeway. That is not going to work,” he said. The issue is likely to resonate in the technical committee meeting to be held at Wagah border on July 16. An official said Pakistan’s resolve to establish a causeway stems from the fact that the structure could be easily dismantled in the event of an eventuality. “If something drastic happens and the corridor becomes inoperative in future, the causeway can be brought down easily. The very purpose of the corridor stands defeated if it gets flooded,” said the official. Cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, who is supervising the operations in his capacity as Dera Baba Nanak MLA, said he was optimistic that the July 16 meeting would offer a solution. “It is a race against time. I hope technical officials will come up with a viable solution which is suitable to both sides,” he said.  Temple issue resolved   The management committee of the temple, which comes in the right of way of the corridor, held a meeting with Dera Baba Nanak SDM Gursimran Singh and NHAI officials. Since the NHAI has already acquired the outer wall of the temple, officials told the committee members that a new wall would be built which would not come in the way before the acquired wall was demolished. The SDM said proper rituals would be followed when the wall is dismantled. "
"Arun Sharma Tribune News Service Ropar, July 2  Mining mafia digging riverbed around power supply towers near Anandpur Sahib has put Electricity Department officials on toes. It is apprehended that these towers with damaged foundations can be washed away during the monsoon and plunge nearly 150 villages into the dark. The officials are working day and night to make alternative arrangements so there is no major blackout in the area.  This has led to long and frequent power cuts in Nurpur Bedi villages. Irked over power cuts, locals have been staging protest almost every day. The foundations laid in the riverbed to erect three towers to supply power to these villages have already been washed away during the last monsoon as the sand had been removed around the foundation of these towers. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });A total of 138 villages, including Nurpur Bedi, were being supplied power through a 33 kv line from Anandpur Sahib till a few years ago. As the demand of power started increasing, the area was being supplied 66 kv power through old power lines which used to create frequent faults. In order to overcome this problem, the department decided to lay a new power supply line for which new towers were installed. Three of these new towers were to be set up in the Sutlej riverbed near Sangatpur village. As soon as the foundations were laid for these towers, mafia dug up sand around their foundation. These foundations were washed away during the monsoon and officials abandoned the work of laying the new power line.  In December last year, it was noticed that the foundations of three old poles in the riverbed being used to supply power to these villages have also been exposed as the sand around these was dug out illegally.  Bhag Singh, SDO, said sand around the poles had been dug out and power could be disrupted during the monsoons if any of these poles were washed away.

Several labourers, accompanied by nearly 50 policemen, covered the structure. The road will now be constructed over it. Earlier, Ceigal India Limited, a Ludhiana-based private company hired by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to complete the project, which hit a roadblock after a dargah and a temple were spotted in the designated ROW.

We took the decision only after we found that the structure was fabricated by the caretaker. The original dargah does not actually fall within the designated ROW and land records proved that the one recently constructed was a sham.” Cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa said the corridor by all means would be complete by October 31. Meanwhile, the temple issue remained unresolved. Sources said the temple’s management committee was based in New Delhi and its members would be arriving soon to discuss the vexed issue with officials. “The land on which the temple is built has already been acquired. However, we will have to discuss the issue with the committee members before we take any action,” Jeetendra said. An official said if the committee members do not come up with a positive response, a part of the temple, including its outer wall and a room, would be demolished. “This may create problems. That is why we are insisting on a plan that will benefit all stakeholders,” the official added. No dialogue on causeway There has been no headway in talks pertaining to the contentious issue of Pakistan building a causeway in its territory. The NHAI wants to build a bridge instead of the causeway. An official said: “If a causeway is constructed there are chances of it being flooded, defeating the very purpose of the corridor. If we can build a bridge on the Indian side, what is stopping the Pakistan government from doing so on in their territory? If there is a bridge, there will be no flooding at all.”"

The nearby agricultural fields, which have the capacity to absorb the excess water, are owned by the Jat Sikhs. The divide between the communities is too palpable to be dismissed. In February this year, a clash took place between the Mashas and the Jats and an FIR was registered. It was perceived to be an altercation between Chaudhury’s men and the Akali-minded Jat Sikhs. A majority of the population belongs to the SC community here. Five months down the line, the political equations have changed but nothing has changed for the poor villagers. Jyoti Bala now says that Chaudhury was unwilling to help them for “reasons best known to the legislator”. “MLA or no MLA, things are simply not moving. To make things worse, water from a nearby pond reverses its flow and enters the houses during monsoon. Every second day we have to take somebody to the Civil Hospital. We have nothing against the Jats or the Akalis. All we want is to find a solution to drain out the contaminated water,” said Pardeep Kumar, a relative of the sarpanch. The DC, however, claimed that his officers were trying to make the Jats see the reason. “The paddy sowing season is on during which water can be used in their fields.

"Our Correspondent  Abohar, February 24 The Kisan Sangharsh Samiti (KSS) has urged the state and Rajasthan governments to initiate relining of the Sirhind and Rajasthan feeder before the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.

"Deepkamal Kaur Tribune News Service Jalandhar, May 20 Amid allegations and counter-allegations between the two main parties, the SAD and the Congress, the real issues affecting residents of the bypoll-bound Shahkot Assembly constituency seem to have taken a backseat. Farming being the main occupation in this rural seat, it is the muskmelon growers of the area who are affected the most. The constituency houses Roopewal, Asia’s largest muskmelon market, which has lost almost all its fruit this year after the recent hailstorm. Farmers rue that despite huge damage, no one bothered to assess their loss or given any assurance to them for providing relief. Vicky Bajwa of Bajwa Kalan village, 10 km from Roopewal, said: “Muskmelon growers here have been badly affected.

Despite this, no leader has visited us.”(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); An Independent candidate, Naib Singh, the namesake of the Akali candidate, hails from Seechewal village, which is a part of the muskmelon belt. He has taken “watermelon” as his poll symbol. “I am contesting the election for the farmers of my area. We don’t get good rates in the market. Our crop has got hit this time,” he said, adding that no party was raking up the issue. Environmentalist Balbir Singh Seechewal, who, too, hails from the constituency, says, “For me, the biggest issue of Shahkot is the cancer-affected villages, located along the Sutlej and Chitti Bein. The incidence of the dreaded disease is high because of untreated, chemical-laden effluent being discharged by factories in Ludhiana and Jalandhar into the water bodies.” Asked if he felt that illegal mining was an issue too, he said: “I think the entire mining policy is faulty. The government should promote mining from the beds of the rivers. The beds have got raised so much because of sedimentation that the water level in rivers remain high, making them prone to flooding.” The issues of no college and playgrounds in Shahkot, too, are common in the discussions.

Bajwa had also ordered the proper maintenance of the ponds for their proper utilisation.

The panchayat said only one out of four ponds was free of encroachments and it needs to be cleaned immediately to prevent overflowing. In March last year, some houses on encroached land in Khuyiansarwer village were demolished. As many as 170 families had raised illegal structures over the dry ponds, resulting in flooding of adjoining areas during monsoon. The area earmarked for ponds was 68 kanal as per panchayat record, but hardly 25 per cent of it was free of encroachments.

"Sanjeev Singh Bariana Tribune News Service Chandigarh, July 30 Punjab may have to pay a price in terms of flooding in many areas as a consequence of the unearthing of alleged scams in the government, which diverted the attention of the Irrigation Ministry, and the Assembly elections earlier this year. The distractions pushed to the backburner certain crucial yearly measures required to prevent floods. A meeting of the Flood Control Committee, which is supposed to be held in January, took place only in April because of the Assembly elections, which delayed the steps required for preparedness. The department issued maintenance tenders as late as June 2 for the amount that was sanctioned on May 25. Another indication of the matter having been ignored is that only 140 of the 850 drains in the state have been cleaned, and merely 36 of the 296 vulnerable spots identified along rivers have received approval for strengthening works. Most such spots have been left out as the government sanctioned only Rs 40 crore to the Irrigation Department for flood management. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The comprehensive Flood Preparedness Memorandum-2017 had sought at least Rs 350 crore. Last year, the SAD-BJP government had released Rs 132 crore. Adding to the worries is 5,000 employees of the Irrigation Department who are in mood for agitation over the Vigilance Bureau making inquiries in multiple cases against engineers and officials. Chief Engineer (Irrigation) AK Bansal said, “Our department has spent approximately Rs 30 crore of the sanctioned amount and the ‘danger areas’ have been adequately strengthened. The remaining Rs 10 crore has been kept aside for exigencies during the monsoon.” Fortifying bundhs Harvinder Singh Sohal, SE (Drainage), says the department has spent Rs 5.8 crore on bundh strengthening along 250 km of the Sutlej and Beas. “This amount has been spent in Kapurthala, Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, Ludhiana and Nawanshahr. Machhiwara block and Nawanshahr along the Sutlej and Sultanpur Lodhi along the Beas are the most vulnerable areas this time,” he says. However, Jaswant Singh of Hussainpur Bule village, whose fields are about 4 km from the bundh, says, “There has been no desilting of the riverbed for the past many years. My paddy crop was washed away in 2012.” Jagjit Singh of Sangra village says, “Since our land falls within the Dhussi Bundh, our paddy crop is damaged every year. There is no one to warn or help us.” Paramjit Singh, another farmer from Passan Kadim village, near Baupur Mand, also alleges there has been no desilting. “They just throw sandbags on the grassy banks in the name of bundh strengthening. As a safeguard, we have raised the plinth of our houses by 10-15 feet,” he says. Ghaggar threat The Ghaggar floods Moonak and Khanauri tehsils at regular intervals. In Khanauri, three identified points cause the maximum devastation. Yet, farmers allege, the authorities wake up only when the monsoons are already upon them. The Drainage Department had sent a proposal for Rs 17.36 crore for Patiala, Mohali and Fatehgarh Sahib districts, but only Rs 2 crore was cleared. There are several rivulets and drains in the area, but only the Jacob drain and the Vaddi Nadi have been cleaned. Clogged drains This is one of the districts where no drain has been cleaned for want of funds. Work on one project on the Beas in the Bet area is underway. Why does it flood  Most damage in Punjab due to floods is caused by the Ravi, Sutlej and Ghaggar, which have a common delta where floodwaters meet; and if in spate simultaneously, these rivers can wreak havoc. The silt deposited by the rivers in the delta area raises bed levels, causing overflow. According to the Punjab Disaster Management Action plan, intense rainfall, inadequate drainage, lack of maintenance of flood control and other works (embankments, drainage system, cross drainage works) aggravate the flood situation.  (Inputs by Parvesh Sharma, Harinder Singh Khaira and Deepkamal Kaur)"

Abohar legislator Sunil Jakhar came across such posters when he visited some houses to convey Independence Day greetings.

"Varinder Singh Tribune News Service Chandigarh, July 11 The solution to silt accumulation in Harike lake — the largest wetland in North India — is finally in sight with the help of pontoon gates. The multi-gated Harike headworks were constructed in 1953 and was located downstream of the confluence of the Sutlej and Beas rivers.  The 4,100 hectare wetland displaying a rich biodiversity had got endangered due to accumulating  silt. The depth of the lake had come down from 23 feet to a mere 10-11 feet.  (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });The flow of the Sutlej and the Beas river waters was controlled at the headworks by 48 steel gates. These gates were set up to control the flow of water and make it available to Rajasthan and parts of Southern Punjab. Excess water was going to Pakistan via the Sutlej. Silting had taken place in the Harike lake and its catchment area over the years as 31 gates meant for flow of excessive water downstream were rusted and useless.  Flooding of the catchment area of Sutlej and Beas had almost become an annual feature in monsoons for these 31 gates meant for release of excessive water in Sutlej were hardly opened during the past 63 years.  The Irrigation Department was on a lookout for a technology which could enable it to get the gates repaired after installing alternative gates.  “Our biggest problem was that unlike other headworks, the Harike headworks were sans any grooves where alternative steel gates could be inserted temporarily,” said an official.  Rust had damaged the old gates that these could not be removed for over six decades. Moreover, the replacement of gates without making alternative arrangements could have played havoc with lives of people along Sutlej,” said KS Pannu, Principal Secretary, Irrigation. A Vishakhapatnam- based company specialising in pontoon bridge technology has come to the rescue of the problem. Now, pontoon gates would be installed during the replacement of the rusted gates.   “The replacement would cost around Rs. 14 crore and the exercise would be completed by September,” said Pannu.  “The water hycinth would be removed by a new machine being imported for Rs 2.5 crore, he added. The department was also trying to control the growth of water haycinth with the help of weedicides.   "
"Jupinderjit Singh Tribune News Service Chandigarh, May 18 ‘Please consider the applicants request positively,’ wrote BJP state president in Punjabi on top of a workers typed application. He was using the third green ink pen for the day having used two already writing such recommendations. Yet, applicants kept pouring in. They were BJP workers who had come in droves from across the state to use opportunity to meet the recently appointed state BJP president and four Cabinet Ministers of the party in the state government.  Today was the first day of the weekly ‘Janta Darbar’ started by the BJP in the election year. The darbar is a Meet the Leaders programme to be held every Wednesday from 11 to 1 at the BJP headquarters here.  A BJP release said about 2000 workers met the leaders today. But by noon, an exhausted Vijay Sampla moved out of his room and sat in the main hall as workers kept flooding in. The AC in the room seemed helpless. Such high number of workers had come    as they had no platform earlier to air their grievances and seek help said a leader. Same was the condition in the offices of the Ministers- Anil Joshi, Surjit Kumar Jyani, Bhagat Chunni Lal and Madan Mohan Mittal.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); On top of the list of demands of the workers were seeking transfer at a favourable place in case of a government employee, help in police cases, jobs for unemployed  and even tubewell connections. The anguish of most of the workers was common:  They had no say in the SAD-BJP government. A safari suit clad worker blurted out before Vijay Sampla, “ The government has not accepted any of our requests for transfer or for jobs. Our party is ruling in the state as well as in the Centre. Where should we go?” he asked. Gurdeep Singh, secretary BJP Kissan Wing, brought applications for seeking tubewell connections, “You need recommendation of the area MLA for getting the connection due to a long queue. The Akali workers are getting recommendation by their MLAs but we are suffering.” Yadwinder Singh Buttar, a former PPP leader from Batala who joined BJP last year said BJP can only exert pressure on the Akalis and the Bureaucracy if they show the power of their vote bank."
"Accra (Ghana), March 25 Surinder Kaur Cheema came to Accra four decades ago from Baroda (Gujarat) to support her businessman husband. Today, she is a hugely successful entrepreneur in her own right with two popular Indian restaurants, is often called on by the diplomatic community to provide catering services on special occasions and is an active social worker. “Cheema must be saluted for single-handedly building one of the most successful Indian restaurants in Ghana,” Amar Deep S Hari, the Indian-origin CEO of prominent IT firm IPMC, told IANS. Cheema arrived in the African country in 1974 to join her award-winning farmer-exporter husband Harcharan Cheema. From a housewife, she later turned to teach at the Ebenezer Secondary School in Accra for a while, and has now settled on selling India through her restaurants. “It was after 13 years that I started my first restaurant, Kohinoor Restaurant at Osu (an Accra suburb). l have now been able to add another one, Delhi Palace at Tema (a port city some 25 km from Accra),” Cheema told IANS. Cheema, who now employs about 35 people, said she would love to increase the number of restaurants she runs “but it is not easy because of my numerous commitments.” (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });She divides her time between running her restaurants and ensuring that women affected with breast cancer get treatment, some rural communities get schools and water. “Through the work of the Indian Women’s Association, we have been able to raise money to get women in the country treated for breast cancer.

Last year, when heavy rain led to the flooding of some parts of Accra, killing several people, Cheema led the association to provide food and other essentials to those who had been rendered homeless.  “I did not meet the women but we were told that the food that was supplied to us was brought by the association and their leader is the one who owns the Kohinoor Restaurants,” Ama Konadu, one of the victims who received the support, said. — IANS "
"Akash Ghai Tribune News Service Mohali, January 29 Unable to tackle waterlogging during rainy season despite engaging the Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai, to find a solution, the Mohali authorities are now banking on experts from Punjab Engineering College, Chandigarh, to tame the problem. The areas affected are Phase 3B1, 3B2, 4, 5 and 11, and Sectors 70, 71 and 65-C. In 2012, the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) had paid several lakhs to the IIT, Mumbai, and an expert panel from the urban drainage department of the institute had surveyed the city and made certain recommendations.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Now, the Municipal Corporation (MC) has tied up with PEC, which would offer suggestions to get rid of the problem. PEC would be paid Rs 17 lakh as fee. A team of PEC experts today surveyed the area along with MC and Punjab Water Supply and Sewerage Board officials. The team also met residents of the affected areas and the municipal councillors concerned. The PEC team would prepare its project report on the issue and recommended solutions to the problem surfacing in certain pockets every year. As per a senior official of Punjab Water Supply and Sewerage Board, the problem occurred as the natural gradient of the city had been disrupted by the 200-ft-wide road leading to the Mohali airport. “The level of the road is much above the level of the affected areas, which disrupts the flow of water resulting in flooding,” said the official. Shockingly, the authorities never implemented the recommendations by the IIT team. The IIT team had advised against repeated re-carpeting of roads, which led to a difference between the levels of road and the houses alongside, causing rainwater to accumulate. It was advised that the road should be dug before re-carpeting. The recommendations were ignored. The IIT team had further advised to upgrade the drainage system of the city, on which the work is yet to start."
"Ruchika M Khanna Tribune News Service Chandigarh, November 25 Reverse bidding policy for the auction of minor minerals (sand and aggregate) quarries in Punjab will be followed as the government prepares to auction 83 quarries beginning next week. With the Akali-BJP government constantly under fire over the high rates of sand and gravel caused by the alleged collusion of politicians and the sand mafia, the government has decided to follow reverse bidding to auction new mines that have received all necessary environmental clearances from the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests. Around 33 of these quarries are to be auctioned between November 30 and December 2. Industry Minister Madan Mohan Mittal, while conforming that the online auction of the quarries was to be done now said the bidders would compete to obtain business from the state and prices would typically decrease as the sellers undercut each other.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); “We are committed to bring down the price of sand and gravel to Rs600-Rs650 per hundred cubic feet so as to facilitate the common man. Thus we will follow reverse bidding as the auction for the new quarries comes up,” he said. The daily demand of sand in the state is estimated at 58,000 tonne approximately. The new mines are expected to supply about 90 lakh tonnes of sand per annum. As of now, the retail price of sand to a consumer in the state is Rs2,000-Rs2,700 per 100 cubic feet and that of aggregate (sand and gravel mix) is Rs2,200-Rs3,100 per 100 cubic feet. With the government facing public ire over the high prices of this basic construction material and attributing it to the nexus between ruling party leaders and the mining contractors, the issue has had widespread political ramifications, with public anger on this issue resulting in voter disillusionment for the ruling Akali-BJP combine in the Lok Sabha elections last year. With the state Assembly elections round the corner, the government now seems to be on correction course. Other than the 33 quarries that are to be auctioned next week, the government has also decided to allow the Irrigation Department to mine sand midstream from riverbeds of the Sutlej and Beas by dredging at over 45 places, as the midstream level of the riverbed has become higher. With the minor minerals from the sides of the rivers being extracted for mining, there are reports of flooding from these rivers at various places. The Mining Department will now issue disposal permits to the Irrigation Department during dredging of canals and rivers, so that the minerals in midstream river beds can be removed and riverbeds levelled. Mittal said the term of auction for another 50 quarries would end in January and they were hopeful of bringing down the bid prices, which in turn would bring down the sand and gravel prices."

"Aman Sood Tribune News Service Patiala, July 15 The tussle between Punjab and Haryana over water sharing just got more intense. With Punjab not willing to release water in the Hansi-Butana canal, the Haryana government was not letting the Punjab government canalise the Ghaggar near Khanauri that was located on the interstate border, said sources. The Punjab government wants to complete the work to stop Ghaggar flooding its villages every monsoon. Sources said the state government had gone out of its way to strengthen the embankment of the Bhakra Main Line (BML) Canal in Sangrur to ensure Haryana got 1,450 cusecs instead of 1,050 cusecs starting May 1. The state government expected that the Haryana government would in return let it canalise 13 km of Ghaggar. However, Haryana has now reportedly backtracked. Sources said the Haryana Irrigation Department had not been letting Punjab government complete the work for the past two years. This resulted in crops on over 500 acres in 10 villages from Makraurh Sahib to Karhail getting inundated as Ghaggar breached its banks. Haryana claims it is unable to get its legitimate share of 3.5 million-acre-foot (MAF) of Ravi-Beas water since the Sutlej-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal has not been built. At present, Haryana gets over 1.65 MAF water through the existing BML canal.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Haryana wants the BML be connected to the intra-state Hansi-Butana canal to draw part of its share of the Ravi-Beas waters.

Khanna Tribune News Service Chandigarh, May 21 The price of sugar in the state has gone up by Rs 200 per quintal, or Rs 2 per kg, following the decision of the Cabinet to impose 11 per cent tax on sugar coming into Punjab from other states. The price of sugar (price at factories) in various parts of the state increased from Rs 2,710-Rs 2,740 per quintal till yesterday, to Rs 2,910-Rs 2,940 per quintal. The retail price of sugar, too, saw a jump immediately, even though the government is yet to issue a notification or bring an ordinance for the imposition of this tax. In the retail market, the prices of sugar too saw a jump of Rs 2 per kg, with prices going up to Rs 30-Rs 34 per kg, in various cities across the state. Industry sources point out that the prices have been increased by unscrupulous sugar traders, who had hoarded sugar and after yesterday’s announcement started selling sugar at a hiked price. The state’s move to impose entry tax was based more on the concern for the nine cooperative and the seven private sugar mills operating in the state. These sugar mills are running in huge losses and have unpaid dues amounting to almost Rs 700 crore, after Punjab increased its State Advised Price (SAP) on cane to Rs 295 per quintal for the recently concluded cane crushing season. With just 9.5 per cent sugar recovery from cane, the sugar mill owners in the state were claiming that the cost of production of sugar was around Rs 3,500 per quintal. Against this, the price of sugar in the open market was just Rs 2,800 per quintal.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The problem for the state arose because Uttar Pradesh — a main sugar producing state — gave a subsidy of Rs 40 per quintal on sugarcane to all sugar mills, on the SAP of Rs 280 per quintal. As a result, the cost of production of sugar in UP is around Rs 2,800 per quintal, as they were paying farmers just Rs 240 per quintal for sugarcane. Since Punjab, with its annual requirement of 60 lakh tonnes of sugar, gets almost 15 lakh tonnes of sugar from Uttar Pradesh, the cheaper sugar from UP started flooding Punjab’s market. It is basically to protect the domestic sugar industry that the government has decided to impose tax on sugar coming here from other states. The sugar industry in the state is happy that the government has intervened to protect the interests of the sugar industry. “Our raw material cost is very high and retail prices have dipped. With the new tax being imposed, at least 90 per cent of dues to cane growers can be paid,” said Inderbir Singh Rana, of Rana Sugars. In December last year, the state government had waived the 3.3 per cent purchase tax imposed on the seven private sugar mills of the state. The nine cooperative sugar mills in the state are already exempt from paying any purchase tax. The government had then reasoned that since other states had waived this tax on cane, they were following suit. The private sugar mills, operated among others by powerful politicians from across the political spectrum, had threatened not to go ahead with the crushing, if they were not bailed out and taxes imposed on them reduced."
"Archit Watts Tribune News Service Tarmala (Lambi), January 3 Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal has described the Centre’s decision to form NITI (National Institution for Transforming India) Aayog by scrapping the Planning Commission as a “historic step” towards implementing “real federal structure” in the country. Badal, who was here for his Sangat Darshan, targeted the top brass of the Planning Commission claiming they were not even aware of the problem of waterlogging in some areas of Punjab.  Contrary to the Chief Minister’s claims, a Planning Commission team did visit Punjab after Badal approached the UPA leadership with a request for a permanent solution to tackle waterlogging. On October 4, 2013, he even submitted an integrated plan of Rs 3,327.57 crore to the Planning Commission to address problems related to reduced sub-soil water level and for preventing flooding in waterlogged areas of south-west Punjab. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Interacting with mediapersons at Tarmala village today, the Chief Minister said the step to form NITI Aayog would ensure more participation of the states in policy-making. Badal alleged the chief ministers of various states who were better connected at the grassroots level were so far ignored while framing policies at the national level. “With the formation of the NITI Aayog, the chief ministers will have more involvement in the planning process, which would boost the overall development of the country,” he said. The Chief Minister slammed the Congress for “excessive centralisation” of powers. He alleged during the UPA regime the states hardly had any say in policy formulation, which resulted in lopsided development of the country. On the ordinance brought by the Centre on land acquisition, Badal said paramount importance must be given to safeguarding the interests of farmers. He said developmental works initiated by the government for the welfare of the people should also not get affected due to any reason. He said adequate compensation should be provided to the farmers whose land was being acquired."
