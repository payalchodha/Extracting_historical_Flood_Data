"Ruchika M Khanna Tribune News Service Chandigarh, October 15 The state government is mulling deferment of repayment of crop loans availed by farmers in flood-hit villages of Doaba and Malwa region by three years. According to a proposal, farmers in 14 districts (794 villages) of the state, whose standing crops were damaged in the floods that occurred in August, would be able to repay the crop loans that they took in April this year within the next three years. Farmers were supposed to deposit the entire loan amount with interest to the banks by end of October. As much as Rs 9,700 crore worth of crop loan was disbursed by cooperative banks in Punjab in April to 7.50 lakh farmers. While marginal farmers (having up to 2.5 acres) got Rs 57,000 per acre as loan, small farmers (having up to 5 acres) got Rs 78,000 per acre as crop loan. Large farmers get up to Rs 27,000 per acre as crop loan. Since a majority of farmers in the flood-ravaged districts are small and marginal farmers, they have suffered huge losses as the floodwaters destroyed their standing crop.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); According to estimates prepared by the Revenue Department, which conducted a special girdawari to assess the crop losses, paddy worth Rs 507 crore on 51,364 hectares, maize on 5,553 hectares and sugarcane on 863 hectares, besides fruits and vegetables on 1,304 on 1,306 hectares was damaged in the floods. Official sources in the government told The Tribune that since the rescheduling of the loan had been approved in principle, farmers would be eligible to avail fresh crop loans. “We have decided to speed up the process of deferment of loan instalments so that farmers can avail fresh loans for the next wheat crop and not look at non-institutional sources of finance,” said a senior officer in the Cooperation Department. “The process is already on to send the report of special girdawari to the cooperative societies and the district central cooperative banks, who will make a list of total amount whose repayment is to be deferred and loan accounts where the deferment is applicable,” he said."
"Aparna Banerji Tribune News Service Jalandhar, October 13 The free of cost wheat seed disbursal in 13 villages of Kapurthala has been hit due to the election code of conduct for the Phagwara bypolls. The government’s decision to disburse wheat seed to flood-affected villagers from October 21 (after the Phagwara bypolls) has earned them farming community’s ire. Right after the floods, the state government had promised free of cost seeds and fertilisers to farmers. However, the process was stalled due to the elections. Farmers say their fields will be ready for sowing in a week or 10 days and the government should ensure early disbursal of wheat seed keeping in view the bypoll. They said seed disbursal after October 21 will considerably delay wheat sowing putting farmers in the flood-hit areas in a fix.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Paramjit Singh from Channwindi village said, “The ideal time to sow wheat crop is till October 25. After that it will be too late. The electoral process and other works have taken precedence over farmers’ needs. By the time the government is planning to start seed disbursal, farmers will be forced to make arrangements for wheat seeds and manure/fertilisers on their own. So far only the Khalsa Aid has given us free manure for the sowing season.” He added that the NGO had begun disbursing free manure and also promised free seeds. Sukhpreet Singh from Passan Kadeem village in Sultanpur Lodhi said, “Farmers need seeds at this time. The provision of seeds after October 21 will be too late and will hit wheat sowing. It is a time-consuming process and neither lists have been made nor any communication made to farmers’ societies regarding provision of seeds. Farmers can’t wait that long. When even girdawari hasn’t been received yet, how can we believe the government will provide seeds in a time-bound manner after October 21.” Sarwan Singh from Baupur village said, “We have raised these demand several times, but to no avail. After incurring huge losses in the foods, farmers will now be forced to shell Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 per acre on wheat sowing.” Ashwini Kumar Rambani, Agricultural Officer, Kapurthala, said, “Due to the code of conduct in place because of the bypolls, the seed disbursal shall be started after the polls. We have sent the demand to the government. The seeds shall readily be distributed among farmers if need be from October 21 in the evening itself after the bypolls. The time formally designated by the government for wheat sowing is from October 21 to November 15. Right now it is too early to sow wheat due to the heat.” Bypoll derails process to procure paddy  Phagwara: Though government agencies started paddy purchase in the state on October 7, the procurement has been tardy in Phagwara as the official machinery busy with bypoll-related assignments. More than 1.30 lakh bags of paddy are lying in the open. Arhtiya Association, Phagwara, president Kulwant Pabbi said only one sheller owner had purchased around 10,000 bags of paddy till now. Government agencies were purchasing, but not lifting paddy. Heaps of paddy are lying  in the open in mandis."

Owning four acres of land, he made good money last season. But this year, he has nothing to sell, his entire crop having been devoured by floods. “My house damaged too, where else do I have to go? I spend the entire day at the mandi with fellow farmers,” he says. About 2,65,000 bags of paddy had arrived at the Gidderpindi mandi last year. This time it is almost nil.  While mandis elsewhere in Punjab are thronged by farmers, there is little activity at mandis in the Lohian block. Not just farmers, commission agents too are in trouble, the latter having made payments in advance to contractors and labourers, who now have nothing to do. One of the commission agents said during the corresponding period last year, around 35,000 bags had arrived at the Gidderpindi mandi. This time the number was just 2,000. At the Nahl mandi, compared to the 1,60,000 bags received last year, the commission agents expect less than 50,000. There are a total of seven mandis in the Lohian block — Gidderpindi, Nahl, Kang Khurd, Mehrajwala, Kamalpur, Turna and Lohian.  The Tribune team that visited these mandis saw most labourers sitting idle. One of them at the Lohian mandi said, “It has been 15 days but we are yet to get work.

"Tribune news Service New Delhi, October 3 Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh today said the state government was fully prepared to counter the resurgence of terror threat from Pakistan. He said Pakistan drone threat should not be linked to the religious occasion of the 550th birth anniversary celebrations of Guru Nanak Dev. The two could not be connected, he told reporters here in response to questions during an informal chat. Asked about border tension in the light of the recent recovery of two drones reportedly smuggling arms from Pakistan into Punjab, the Chief Minister said the issue had nothing to do with Kartarpur corridor opening to mark the 550th Parkash Purb. Asked if the matter was discussed with the Prime Minister during a meeting today, the CM said he met the PM only to extend an invite for the Gurpurb celebrations. The state government was dealing with the matter and was geared to maintain law and order in Punjab at any cost, he said, adding, “We will not allow anyone to disturb the state’s peace and harmony.” Pakistan was trying to create disharmony and disturbance in Punjab not just through drones, but also through infiltration and narco-terrorism, Captain Amarinder said. “We will not let that happen, we have no doubt that we are fully equipped to deal with them,” he added.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); In response to another question, the CM said he had asked the IAF and the BSF to heighten alert at the border in view of the discovery of the drone infiltration. Meanwhile, Capt Amarinder urged the Centre to take up cannalisation of the state’s three eastern rivers of the Indus Water System as a national project. In a proposal to the PM, he suggested construction of high-speed economic corridors on the 985-km-long river embankments, apart from river training works, flood protection measures and lining of internal side-slopes of the Sutlej, Ravi and Beas.

"Tribune News Service  New Delhi, October 3  Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday urged the Central Government to take up canalisation of the state’s three eastern rivers of the Indus water system as a national project, to enable conservation of water and enhancement of the region’s economic growth.  In his proposal presented to Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a meeting here, the Chief Minister suggested construction of high-speed economic corridors on 985 km long river embankments, apart from river training works, flood protection measures and lining of internal side-slopes of the Sutlej, Ravi and Beas. The move, Capt Amarinder said, would help the state enhance its ‘jal shakti’ (water power) to encourage diversification of agriculture, promote quality urbanisation and colonisation, and to speed up industrialisation for better and quicker economic emancipation of our citizens.    Complimenting the Prime Minister on his initiative to provide drinking water to each household in the country, through the creation of the new Ministry of Jal Shakti, and the inception of Jal (water) Jeevan (life) Mission and the “Nal se Jal” (tap water) scheme, Captain Amarinder said his government also stands committed to the cause of providing drinking water to its citizens under the initiative ‘Har Ghar Pani, Har Ghar Safai’ (water and sanitation for every household).  The Chief Minister, while expressing concern over the state’s reduction in ‘jal shakti’ at the time of India’s Partition and against during the reorganisation of the state in 1966, pointed out that the three perennial rivers of the Sutlej, Ravi and Beas irrigate only about 27 per cent of the state’s cultivated area, leading to over-exploitation of the ground water. It is apprehended, he further noted, that seven districts of the state will transform into a desert in the near future, with sure signs of poverty revisiting these areas.   Underlining the need to increase water productivity through augmentation and strengthening of water management, control and regulation infrastructure, Captain Amarinder suggested launch of the cannalisation project with the Sutlej river, which would require an investment of about Rs.4000 crore (US $ 0.7 billion) over a period of 3 to 5 years, exclusive of external incentives such as commercial exploitation of Government and private land and waiver of taxes, duties and cesses, as relevant. The task may begin with a feasibility study that may be assigned to techno-economic experts of international repute, he suggested.  The Chief Minister assured that the state would extend its full cooperation to get the proposal realised in terms of sending a team of officers from the Punjab Government to engage and discuss the same with the officials of the Union Ministry of Jal Shakti.   Captain Amarinder also underlined the need to harness the river water which was currently flowing into Pakistan during the monsoons. Pointing out that the three rivers as of now have kutcha (earthen) embankments, measuring 945.24 km; (Sutlej 484.12 km, Ravi 245.28 km and Beas 215.84 km), covering almost over 60 per cent of state’s area, he observed that the 1/3rd of the state’s population living in the riverfront areas was also suffering due to the flooding that occurs during the monsoon period. The canalisation of rivers and development of riverfront areas will expand activities leading to widening of the base of Punjab’s economy, diversifying economic activities and sources of livelihood for State’s rapidly growing younger generation, he added."

Now that the children have started coming regularly again, the absence of teachers has made it difficult for them to cover the syllabus properly. A teacher from surrounding schools comes here on deputation on a weekly basis according to a roster. There are 13 students in the school. The situation prevails not just in this school at Mehrajwala but also at Kamaalpur in the same block where there are 28 students.

Sources said due to shortage of teachers in the entire block, it is difficult to spare and depute staff in ‘teacherless’ schools. Also, teachers in the area cannot even easily take leave as it then becomes difficult to arrange staff for other schools. The teachers, who are sent on deputation, said students in both the schools suffer in such a situation. “It is not easy to deal with the students where there are no regular teachers because when teachers keep on shuffling, neither the students nor the teachers develop connectivity. Also, it becomes difficult to understand the level of the students, which is why the problem arises,” said a teacher on deputation to one of these schools. In Shahkot-I block too, there are three schools - GPS Chak Chela has 40 students, GPS Patto Khurd has 12 and GPS Rajewal Khurd, where there are no regular teachers. District Education Officer (DEO) Rampal Saini said, “The department is aware of the problem. Owing to some transfers and promotions in the past, a few blocks in the district have been facing a staff shortage. But after rationalisation and recruitment, the problem will be resolved.”"

"GS PaulTribune News Service Amritsar, September 12 Keeping in view its non-viability of the product, the cement importers have decided to forego their consignments stuck at the Integrated Check Post (ICP), Attari, for the past six months. As a fallout of the Pulwama attack, the Centre had imposed 200 per cent duty on goods to be imported from Pakistan since February 16.  This economic boycott has cost traders heavily on the either side of the border. Cement was a key import from Pakistan. There’s been no custom duty on cement imports from Pakistan since 2007, making it competitive in comparison to the Indian product. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The cement demand was at its peak in India after the Modi government announced Rs 5,000-crore rehabilitation projects for the flood-hit Kerala.  Till February 16, it invited an import duty of 7.5 per cent only. But post Pulwama attack, the 200 per cent duty effectively ended in a ban on any purchase from Pakistan. It worked as a blessing in disguise for the domestic cement companies which were reeling under the impact of low demand and high GST. It is learnt that they have also increased their rates now.  Nonetheless, at least 90,000 bags of cement are lying at Attari.  As the cement is a perishable commodity, any undue delay in clearing the cargo results in its value degradation and damage.   A prominent cement importer, MPS Chatha, said the strength of cement tends to weaken after two months. “Under present circumstances, it will not be practical for us to accept the goods even if  we are charged normal duty,” he said.  “After the HC orders which went in favour of us, I had gone to collect my consignment of around 1,600 bags. I was bewildered to see that the cement had thickened and lost its property. This was the condition even as the sacks were stored in the middle of the storage. The consignments of other cement importers too has been spoilt,” he said.  Chatha said a bag of Pakistani cement normally used to cost between Rs 250-Rs 300 after paying normal duty. Now it invites an import duty of Rs 800 each bag.  On the other hand, the Indian cement suppliers, which used to offer a bag of cement at Rs 275, were now asking nothing less than Rs 470 per bag, he said.  Besides cement, around 6,000 bags of dry dates, 500 metric tonne of limestone, gypsum and inorganic chemicals and drugs in bulk are still lying at the cargo hold of the ICP, Attari, for want of customs clearance. The Indian importers had pleaded their cause in the High Court which had further directed the authorities to release the withheld goods that had arrived from Pakistan till the duty hours i.e. till 5 pm of February 16 on normal duty charges. The notification was received at 8 pm and was uploaded at 8.45 pm. However, the goods could not be cleared as the traders were asked to pay the demurrage charges."

"Tribune News Service  New Delhi, October 3  Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday urged the Central Government to take up canalisation of the state’s three eastern rivers of the Indus water system as a national project, to enable conservation of water and enhancement of the region’s economic growth.  In his proposal presented to Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a meeting here, the Chief Minister suggested construction of high-speed economic corridors on 985 km long river embankments, apart from river training works, flood protection measures and lining of internal side-slopes of the Sutlej, Ravi and Beas. The move, Capt Amarinder said, would help the state enhance its ‘jal shakti’ (water power) to encourage diversification of agriculture, promote quality urbanisation and colonisation, and to speed up industrialisation for better and quicker economic emancipation of our citizens.    Complimenting the Prime Minister on his initiative to provide drinking water to each household in the country, through the creation of the new Ministry of Jal Shakti, and the inception of Jal (water) Jeevan (life) Mission and the “Nal se Jal” (tap water) scheme, Captain Amarinder said his government also stands committed to the cause of providing drinking water to its citizens under the initiative ‘Har Ghar Pani, Har Ghar Safai’ (water and sanitation for every household).  The Chief Minister, while expressing concern over the state’s reduction in ‘jal shakti’ at the time of India’s Partition and against during the reorganisation of the state in 1966, pointed out that the three perennial rivers of the Sutlej, Ravi and Beas irrigate only about 27 per cent of the state’s cultivated area, leading to over-exploitation of the ground water. It is apprehended, he further noted, that seven districts of the state will transform into a desert in the near future, with sure signs of poverty revisiting these areas.   Underlining the need to increase water productivity through augmentation and strengthening of water management, control and regulation infrastructure, Captain Amarinder suggested launch of the cannalisation project with the Sutlej river, which would require an investment of about Rs.4000 crore (US $ 0.7 billion) over a period of 3 to 5 years, exclusive of external incentives such as commercial exploitation of Government and private land and waiver of taxes, duties and cesses, as relevant. The task may begin with a feasibility study that may be assigned to techno-economic experts of international repute, he suggested.  The Chief Minister assured that the state would extend its full cooperation to get the proposal realised in terms of sending a team of officers from the Punjab Government to engage and discuss the same with the officials of the Union Ministry of Jal Shakti.   Captain Amarinder also underlined the need to harness the river water which was currently flowing into Pakistan during the monsoons. Pointing out that the three rivers as of now have kutcha (earthen) embankments, measuring 945.24 km; (Sutlej 484.12 km, Ravi 245.28 km and Beas 215.84 km), covering almost over 60 per cent of state’s area, he observed that the 1/3rd of the state’s population living in the riverfront areas was also suffering due to the flooding that occurs during the monsoon period. The canalisation of rivers and development of riverfront areas will expand activities leading to widening of the base of Punjab’s economy, diversifying economic activities and sources of livelihood for State’s rapidly growing younger generation, he added."

Also, it becomes difficult to understand the level of the students, which is why the problem arises,” said a teacher on deputation to one of these schools. In Shahkot-I block too, there are three schools - GPS Chak Chela has 40 students, GPS Patto Khurd has 12 and GPS Rajewal Khurd, where there are no regular teachers. District Education Officer (DEO) Rampal Saini said, “The department is aware of the problem. Owing to some transfers and promotions in the past, a few blocks in the district have been facing a staff shortage. But after rationalisation and recruitment, the problem will be resolved.”"

Cement was a key import from Pakistan. There’s been no custom duty on cement imports from Pakistan since 2007, making it competitive in comparison to the Indian product. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The cement demand was at its peak in India after the Modi government announced Rs 5,000-crore rehabilitation projects for the flood-hit Kerala.  Till February 16, it invited an import duty of 7.5 per cent only. But post Pulwama attack, the 200 per cent duty effectively ended in a ban on any purchase from Pakistan. It worked as a blessing in disguise for the domestic cement companies which were reeling under the impact of low demand and high GST. It is learnt that they have also increased their rates now.  Nonetheless, at least 90,000 bags of cement are lying at Attari.  As the cement is a perishable commodity, any undue delay in clearing the cargo results in its value degradation and damage.   A prominent cement importer, MPS Chatha, said the strength of cement tends to weaken after two months. “Under present circumstances, it will not be practical for us to accept the goods even if  we are charged normal duty,” he said.  “After the HC orders which went in favour of us, I had gone to collect my consignment of around 1,600 bags. I was bewildered to see that the cement had thickened and lost its property. This was the condition even as the sacks were stored in the middle of the storage. The consignments of other cement importers too has been spoilt,” he said.  Chatha said a bag of Pakistani cement normally used to cost between Rs 250-Rs 300 after paying normal duty. Now it invites an import duty of Rs 800 each bag.  On the other hand, the Indian cement suppliers, which used to offer a bag of cement at Rs 275, were now asking nothing less than Rs 470 per bag, he said.  Besides cement, around 6,000 bags of dry dates, 500 metric tonne of limestone, gypsum and inorganic chemicals and drugs in bulk are still lying at the cargo hold of the ICP, Attari, for want of customs clearance. The Indian importers had pleaded their cause in the High Court which had further directed the authorities to release the withheld goods that had arrived from Pakistan till the duty hours i.e. till 5 pm of February 16 on normal duty charges. The notification was received at 8 pm and was uploaded at 8.45 pm. However, the goods could not be cleared as the traders were asked to pay the demurrage charges."

"Tribune News Service  Chandigarh, September 10 The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Tuesday condemned the Congress government for burdening the state exchequer with the appointment of six legislators as advisers in the rank of ministers at a time when it was unable to give mid-day meals, SC scholarships, social welfare benefits, sugarcane dues, DA allowance or even release money for the flood-hit or for celebrating the 550th Parkash Purb of Guru Nanak Dev. Addressing a press conference, former minister Bikram Singh Majithia said it was shocking that the Congress government had appointed advisers at a time when it was denying due benefits to all sections of society. “It seems that the Congress is only focused on saving its government from immediate collapse and has in this process even decided to fritter away the scarce resources of the state. This amounts to daylight robbery of the exchequer,” he alleged, adding that with the latest addition the total number of political appointees in the government had risen to 26 with there being 12 advisers, four political secretaries, 9 OSDs and one CPS.

"Aakanksha N Bhardwaj Tribune News Service Jalandhar, September 8 Floods have affected everything, including relations which are yet to be materialised. Marriage proposals, which were in process of finalisation or reached at almost final stage, were wiped out. The dreams of getting married and starting a new life had started taking shape on 19-year-old Usha Rani’s (name changed) mind when the family of the man she was getting married to came to their house and asked to finalise the date. The very next day floods washed away everything along with savings her parents had kept for the marriage. Her family in Mundi Cholian village had planned to do marriage within a month but now they are left with no other option but to postpone it. This is the sad tale of the families who had saved for their daughter’s marriages throughout their lives and now that everything has gone, the families are in a dilemma whether they should gather themselves first or think of marriage.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); New permutations and combinations have started taking shape. Now, shape of relations will depend upon the gravity of loss caused by floods. Usha Rani’s mother Dalip Kaur said that after years of hard work they had gathered money and ornaments for her daughter’s marriage, but she was still finding out what had got washed away and what was left with her. “We have lost our cattle. Our kutcha house has developed cracks. There is knee-deep water in the house,” the worried mother said. Harmesh Singh of the same village is also disturbed. Marriage of his 20-year-old sister Kirpal Kaur (name changed) is due next month. He had bought a washing machine and a bed for her marriage which are now redundant. Singh says his father has been unable to work for the last 12 years due to fracture in his leg. Harmesh is the only one earning. The crop on two-acre land he owned and the other two acre which he had taken on lease has got destroyed due to the rain fury. His father Gurbachan Singh says, “Three days before floods hit our village, the groom’s family had asked us to fix the marriage date. After that, the catastrophe destroyed everything and now we are waiting for the water to recede fully and then we will think about marriage. Also we will have to tell them that there is not much left with us now.” Another villager, Tarsem Kaur, had kept the savings for her daughter’s marriage in a protected manner, but now she finds nothing in the submerged house. “We had a meeting due with the family of the boy. “We had a mediator who was going to arrange the meet. We had thought that if everything goes well, within 15 days, we would get our 20-year-old daughter Sangeeta Rani (name changed) married,” Kaur said, adding that after this disaster, it was too difficult to arrange them together and start a new life. The sufferers said that no one else could have even a slight feeling of the problems these flood-affected villagers have been facing. For the outer world, this deluge means only about flooding, water receding, schools opened and electricity connection restored, but only the people of this area know what havoc this has brought and what hopes and desires have been washed away by the flood.

Computer sets of the school had remained immersed in floodwater for 12 days.

"Ruchika M Khanna Tribune News Service Chandigarh, August 31 The calamity that struck Punjab on August 18, when heavy downpour led to rise in water level of the Sutlej and Beas, could have been averted to a large extent. The encroachments on riverbeds and along the banks of the Sutlej, large-scale mining of sand and inability of the government in clearing crops, poplar tree plantations and wild growth from riverbeds collectively led to the massive flooding in six districts. Admitting that there have been lapses by the successive state governments, the Capt Amarinder Singh government is now willing to right the wrongs, and avoid such disasters in future. Though the Sutlej and Beas were in spate following a heavy downpour, had the successive governments kept tabs on the said violations, it is likely that the damage and flooding would not have been as massive as witnessed now.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Wherever the ownership of dried-up riverbeds is in private hands, farmers have gone for poplar plantation or grown crops. And the tracts of land where ownership rests with the government, the drainage wing of the Department of Water Resources, working on a skeletal budget, failed to clear the wild vegetation. The Northern India Canal and Drainage Act, meant to regulate irrigation, navigation and drainage, is clear that even at places where ownership is in private hands, the government has the power to prohibit and remove obstructions in the natural flow of water and recover the cost from the owner. Government officials agree that the Act has barely been put to use in recent past, leading to tree plantations and overgrowth of vegetation in river beds, that obstructed the gushing waters and led to flooding along embankments. Official sources have told The Tribune that the state government had allocated Rs 100 crore to the drainage wing for this year, of which over Rs 30 crore was spent for relining the river banks and a similar amount for cleaning the drains.  Since the project of Rs 418 crore to clear the riverbeds of encroachments and for flood management programme in the two rivers, is pending with the Central Water Commission (CWC), the state had no resources. Trees and wild growth obstructed the flow of water in the Sutlej, where not just BBMB released water to protect the dam, but water flowing in from the Swan (89,000 cusecs) and Siswan (65,000 cusecs) rivers, too led to the overflowing of the river. Officials admit that another major reason behind flooding was mining. Illegal miners seem to have weakened dhussi bundhs. The BBMB authorities have often said mining was a serious issue. Even World Bank had earlier refused to fund a project for channelising the seasonal rivulets that flow into the Sutlej because of mining (legal and illegal). At many places, large tracts of riverbeds have been encroached by squatters as well as colonisers. Over 1.47 lakh acres of the Sutlej floodplain (land adjacent to the river) has been encroached upon. Sources say that the Sutlej river, as it meanders downstream thins to a width of just 20 ft from 100 ft as it nears Ropar, especially near the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT). With illegal construction remaining unchecked for decades, this too contributed to flooding as unprecedented discharge of water was witnessed. Survey begins in Phillaur, Shahkot  The Jalandhar administration has started the process to conduct girdawari in flood-hit villages to assess the loss suffered by farmers and locals. Teams of revenue officers have started the process in Phillaur and Shahkot subdivisions.

Meanwhile, more than 1,500 tubewells in 24 villages have got affected as per the assessment by the PSPCL. The officials said the exact number will come out when the water recedes. Officials said there might be chances that farmers would have to dig bores again. “Due to the vast amount of sludge which has covered everything, including tubewells, pumps, motors, starters, etc, almost 70-80 per cent of tubewells will become redundant and new bores will have to be dug which will cost high,” a farmer said.  “This time, mandis will be empty,” said Sarabjit Singh of Sardarwala village. “Had everything been alright, basmati would have started coming in the mandis and after that paddy, but this time, thousands of farmers in over 50 affected villages will not be able to sell anything,” he added. The farmers said they would have earned Rs 50,000-60,000 per acre for their crop but due to the deluge, they had suffered huge losses. “We wait for this time for the whole year but this time, we have been unlucky,” said Harneet Singh from Sardarwala village.

"Deepkamal Kaur Tribune News Service Jalandhar, August 28 Over the years, crores have been spent on irrigation and flood control on the 1,400-km dhussi bundh in the state. Around Rs 22.66 crore has been sanctioned for this fiscal too. But after witnessing last week’s flood havoc across Jalandhar alone, it now seems that either the funds were less or these were improperly utilised as the Sutlej banks unexpectedly gave way at 18 points, leading to the worst-ever disaster. As many as 21 villages remained flooded in Phillaur and Shahkot subdivisions for nearly a week with huge losses incurred by all departments, including the PSPCL, Railways, School Education and Agriculture. Even though the final estimates for the repair work of the bundhs are yet to be prepared but it is learnt that all big and small breaches would require at least Rs 10 crore.

The most affected Lohian-Shahkot area, which falls in the 45-km section, got just Rs 30 lakh. This amount gets used up in cleaning just 15 km of drains.” Talking about the reasons for Lohian villages bearing the maximum brunt, drainage officials said, “This area forms a deadlock with gates at Harike lying shut. There was no way for water to go beyond. So, the water got collected here, which just kept on spreading, flooding more villages each day.” DC Varinder Kumar Sharma said, “I do not want to get into the debate on the working of the Drainage Department. I am more concerned about getting all breaches plugged. All breaches in Phillaur have been filled. We’ve got access to four-five breaches in Lohian beyond Janian Chahal village.

"Vishav Bharti Tribune News Service Chandigarh, August 27 With most of the fertile land on the Sutlej banks encroached upon for farming and other activities, the recent flood fury in Punjab was a tragedy waiting to happen. Consecutive governments did nothing to change the situation. Since Independence, a total of 1.47 lakh acres (57 per cent) of the Sutlej floodplain (land adjacent to river) falling in Punjab have slowly been encroached upon. The total land on the Sutlej banks in Punjab is 2.57 lakh acre. A geographical study based on satellite imagery and statistics of the past seven decades has revealed that till 1975, just 45 per cent of the Sutlej floodplains in Punjab were occupied. However, over the next four decades, humans took control over most of the water bodies, vegetation, wetlands, barren and sandy land. By 2012, humans had encroached upon 95 per cent of the floodplains.  The study, ‘Moving towards Risk: A Melancholic Story of Punjab Satluj Floodplain’, was published by Germany-based prominent academic publisher Springer last year.   Dr Harsimrat Kaur Gill, author of the study, who is an assistant professor at Chandigarh’s Post Graduate Government College, Sector 46, says, “the present tragedy was bound to happen as nobody paid heed to the blatant abuse of the river land in the past seven decades.”(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The study found that 1975 onwards, there was a clear dominance of human activities, including agriculture and construction, over the land near the river. This use came at the cost of natural landscape, including vegetation, wasteland, wetland and water bodies. “An analysis reveals that every inch of the available fertile part of the landscape was totally transformed for agricultural land at the cost of natural cover of the river.” The biggest chunk of this encroachment was done for the two activities — agriculture and construction. In the past five decades the trend of encroachment is continuously increasing. Like between 1975-1989, just 9,367 acre was encroached for the two activities. However, it increased to 12,025 acre between 1989-2000. In next five years, the figure stood at 13,920 acres. It was 14,558 acre between 2005-2011. Significantly, it was the time when land and sand mafia ruled the state. She says the changes came at the cost of natural cover. “Inherited natural physical features disappeared from the Sutlej habitat with every passing decade. This trend tells the tragic tale of use and abuse of the earth by humans and how a river is being turned into a hazardous cave.”"

"Ruchika M Khanna Tribune News Service Chandigarh, August 26 Three months after the 2018-19 cane crushing season came to an end, the cash-strapped government is yet to pay the subsidy of Rs 25 per quintal to growers in the state. As a result, farmers have launched an agitation against the government. Hundreds of cane growers held a protest outside the sugar mill at Mukerian and another protest was held outside the office of Hoshiarpur DC today. Two days ago, farmers had protested in Tanda, demanding their dues from the sugar mill. In December last year, after private sugar mills refused to pay the state advised price (SAP) of Rs 310 per quintal to the farmers, citing steep fall in prices of sugar, the government had agreed to bear part of the SAP (Rs 25 per quintal). The private sugar mills, owned by politicians from across the political spectrum, had expressed their inability to pay “high” SAP for sugarcane, as sugar prices then had dropped to Rs 2,900 per quintal. It was only after the assurance given by the state to pay part of the SAP (Rs 25 per quintal) that these private sugar mills had started crushing cane.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); However, eight months down the line, the state has been unable to release their part of the subsidy to the seven private sugar mills. “We have been forced to take the path of agitation. On one hand, the government talks of diversification, while on the other, it falters on supporting us,” said Jangveer Singh, president, Doaba Kisan Committee, which is spearheading the agitation. Data collected by The Tribune shows that of Rs 136.62 crore that the state had to pay to the farmers, Rs 70 crore has been disbursed. However, because of floods, the dues have been held back as most money is going towards flood relief. At many places, the money has not been released by the mills. Gurpratap Singh, a cane grower, said some mills had received the government’s share of SAP, but were not disbursing it further to farmers. A team of officials from the agriculture and cooperative departments today held a meeting with the mill owners and cane growers. Jaswant Singh, Cane Commissioner, said he was hopeful of the issue being resolved within a month. “The government has already released Rs 70 crore, and the remaining dues will be paid in due course,” he said. Other than the Punjab government’s share of SAP not being released, both private as well as cooperative sugar mills too have pending dues running into over Rs 715 crore. While private sugar mills (other than the one in Amloh that has cleared all its dues) have to pay Rs 440 crore to farmers, the cooperative mills are yet to clear payment of Rs 275 crore to farmers, which includes Rs 25 crore of 2017-18."

"Dera Baba Nanak: Cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa is grappling with life’s many uncertainties. He is Punjab government’s pointsman to oversee the supervision of the Kartarpur corridor in his capacity as the MLA of Dera Baba Nanak. He often climbs atop one of the security towers installed by the BSF at the International Border (IB) and is pleased at the progress of the work on the Pakistan side, but the same is not true back home. The NHAI and the Land Ports Authority of India are lagging far behind. The Integrated Check Post (ICP), an integral part of the corridor, is not even half complete. Time is fast running out for the October 31 deadline and so is minister’s patience. “Pakitanis are running like a hare while we are walking like a snail. It is time we pick up speed to beat the hare.” The minister probably forgot that when it comes to running, there is no match between a hare and a snail. Forgotten heroes Abohar: Twenty-five years ago when Gurcharan Singh Gill was serving with Punjab National Bank, he formed an NGO, Punjabi Sabhyachar Manch, and sought to celebrate martyrdom day of Shaheed Bhagat Singh. He, however, couldn’t find a portrait of any freedom fighter at local shops. He then took a pledge to observe the birth and death anniversaries of freedom movement heroes/leaders and motivated booksellers and stationers to arrange their portraits. Supported by retired PCS officer BL Sikka, Gill raised a team of social activists and started observing these days in different schools. The NGO distributed hundreds of mementoes among students and teachers, each carrying pictures of freedom heroes. “The impact was so deep that many families even replaced filmstars’ posters with the mementoes gifted by us,” his associate Kulbhushan Hiteshi claims.

Sidhu successfully ousted Congress veteran RL Bhatia. Almost a decade later, Jaitley replaced Sidhu to contest the Amritsar Lok Sabha seat, after the latter expressed his displeasure with the alliance partner SAD leaders Sukhbir Singh Badal and Bikram Singh Majithia.

The IMCT has been mandated to visit Meghalaya, Assam, Tripura, Bihar, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala to make final recommendations to the Centre for allocation of flood assistance to the flood-ravaged states.  Singh said he had already written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking a special flood relief package of Rs 1,000 crore for compensating the losses resulting from floods in the state.  It is estimated, as per initial calculations, that the state has suffered damage worth Rs 1,700 crore.  Singh, who was extensively touring the affected areas, had also urged the prime minister to instruct authorities to waive crop loans availed by affected farmers from banks/financial institutions during the current cropping season.  Recent rains and release of excess water from Bhakra dam to Sutlej river had caused extensive damage to standing crops and had inundated residential areas in several districts including Jalandhar, Kpaurthala, Ludhiana, Ferozepur, Rupnagar and Kapurthala.  Meanwhile, Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, Balbir Singh Sidhu, Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria, Gurpreet Singh Kangar, Bharat Bhushan Ashu and Punjab Assembly Speaker Rana K P Singh spent the day overseeing the relief and rescue operations in Doaba and Malwa. Sarkaria said the work of plugging a 175 feet-wide breach near Bholewal village in Ludhiana and a 380 feet-wide breach at Meowal village in Jalandhar would be completed by Saturday night. Meanwhile, Bajwa donated one month's salary to the CM Relief Fund. Additional Chief Secretary Vishavjeet Khanna said in Jalandhar that the state government would provide free high-quality wheat seeds to the affected farmers for the upcoming Rabi season. Khanna, who visited the flood-hit villages in Jalandhar, said the basic motive was to extend a helping hand to the farmers in this hour of crisis. He said they would be provided high yielding varieties of seed as apart from their crops the flood water also destroyed the seeds. PTI"

"Ruchika M Khanna Tribune News Service Chandigarh, August 21 Even as the state remained on the edge, with almost 75,000 cusecs water being released by the BBMB, the government is grappling with the issue of compensating farmers, who have suffered losses worth crores. The government has been dilly-dallying on formulating a crop insurance policy, which could have been useful to compensate farmers whose losses are now estimated at Rs 750 crore. In such a situation, the relief that the state can offer is just Rs 12,200 per hectare (or Rs 5,083.33 per acre) from the State Disaster Relief Management Fund, unless the Centre recognises flooding in Punjab as a natural disaster and gives it a flood relief package.  It is only then the cash-strapped state can look at a more decent compensation to be awarded to farmers. At places, where the farmers have suffered a loss of more than one crop (in Fazilka- Abohar, where besides horticulture crops, cotton is grown), Rs 5,625 per acre would be given for loss of horticulture crops and Rs 5,083.33 per acre for other crops sown along with kinnows. Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh today wrote to the Prime Minister, seeking a Rs 1,000-crore special package, besides asking him to instruct the authorities to waive crop loans taken by farmers in affected villages for the current cropping season. The flooding in the Sutlej due to discharge of water from Bhakra Dam has caused extensive damage to crops, inundating 326 villages of Ropar, Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Moga, Ferozepur and Kapurthala. It is estimated that crop on 1.20 lakh acres of cultivated area is submerged.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Official sources, however, say that it would not be easy to get relief from the Centre, considering that the state decided against adopting the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. Punjab had opted out of PMFBY in 2016 (when the Akali-BJP was in power). Three years on, the state government is still considering on whether to come up with a crop insurance scheme or set up a crop compensation fund. Interestingly, Punjab Farmers and Farm Workers Commission had recommended that an insurance corporation be set up to compensate farmers for crop loss. They had recommended that farmers pay a levy of Re 1 per bag, with a matching levy to be paid by the state to create a corpus of Rs 250 crore each year (considering 2.50 crore bags of wheat and paddy reach mandis each year). The sources agree that on an average, Punjab has had to release Rs 100-150 crore crop damage compensation to farmers each year for the past seven years. In 2015, because of the whitefly attack on cotton, crop worth Rs 650 crore was damaged. Last year, too, Rs 100 crore was released for fields in Majha region getting submerged. “The only way to go forward would be to have a crop insurance scheme or a corpus to compensate farmers in case of loss of crop. A decision in favour of either of these options will have to be taken soon,” said a officer.  Floods & the aftereffects  Army, NDRF and SDRF pressed in service in Jalandhar and Ferozepur. 36,000 pranthas and 18,000 packets of dry rations and water bottles air dropped in Jalandhar villages by six Army choppers.

"Vijay Mohan Tribune News Service Chandigarh, August 17 While the forecast of heavy rains in the region over the next few days poses a risk to life and property, it is also welcome news to the water management authorities as far as the Pong Dam is concerned. The reservoir at the dam, which lies in Himachal Pradesh across the Beas, is at present filled up to 60 per cent of its total capacity, which is still a notch below the average storage of the past 10 years at this time of the season.  Read Also:   Flood alert as Sutlej water enters villages Threat looms over 27 Jalandhar villages Level in Pong Dam below average, more rain won’t harm Punjab on alert as more Bhakra water on way   “Unlike the Bhakra Dam, where the water inflow is primarily dependent on snowmelt, rain water accounts for over 80 per cent of the Pong Dam’s inflow,” on official of the Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) said. Following unusual heavy rains in autumn last, the Pong Dam had filled up to full capacity but the storage had fallen to 32 per cent by early July this year, according to data available with the Central Water Commission. Both the Bhakra and Pong dams are critical for power generation and irrigation in the region. They have an installed generation capacity of 1,325 MW and 396 MW, respectively, and supply water for drinking and irrigation to Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Delhi and Chandigarh. One reason for the Pong Dam’s relatively low storage is low rainfall in the dam’s catchment area. Monsoon has been deficient by 21 per cent so far in Himachal, with the shortfall in the upper areas like Lahaul and Spiti and Chamba being as high as 68 per cent and 50 per cent, respectively. Bhakra, on the other hand has already filled up to over 82 per cent of its capacity, which is about 20 per cent more that the average storage of the past 10 years. With warnings of heavy rainfall issued by the Meteorological Department, the BBMB authorities had opened the dam’s sluice gates yesterday to release more water than usual for catering to heavy inflow. Since the dam’s filling season officially extends up to September 30 and rains as well as snowmelt are likely to continue, the BBMB authorities expect that the Bhakra Dam’s reservoir will reach its maximum permissible limit of 1,680 feet, with an additional 3 ft buffer to cater to any emergent situation like a cloudburst.

As part of the agreement reached at the second round of official-level talks at Wagah, Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) cardholders will be allowed to use the corridor. However, Pakistan said it would implement most of these measures in a phased manner, citing infrastructure constraints.

India sought visa-free and no-cost access seven days a week to 5,000 pilgrims of all faiths, including those holding Persons of Indian Origin (PIO) cards. The Indian multi-ministry delegation was led by SCL Das, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs. What has emerged so far is the pilgrims will be allowed visa-free travel as individuals or in groups and also on foot only during the day. Sources say the modalities regarding 5,000 pilgrims daily and 10,000 on special occasions, the fee (India wants it free) and the issue of a bridge will be negotiated in the subsequent meetings. The Pakistan side refused to divulge details about the meeting on the grounds that discussions are still ongoing. “Eighty per cent of the issues have been agreed upon and further information will only be shared after the agreement is finalised,” said Pakistan Foreign Office spokesperson Shah Mohamed Faisal. Most of the information that came in after the meeting was through a press release by the Indian delegation for the talks and its slightly modified version put out by the MEA. The Indian side was not satisfied by Pakistan’s assurance to implement most of the issues in a phased manner and requested it to reconsider its development plans for the corridor to get it fully functional by November. It also wanted Pakistan to allow 10,000 pilgrims in November on Guru Nanak’s 550th birth anniversary.

"Ravi Dhaliwal Tribune News Service Dera Baba Nanak, July 14 With Pakistan finally agreeing to construct a 300-m-long bridge instead of a causeway till the International Border (IB), the threat of floods in Dera Baba Nanak town and its adjoining areas has subsided. Pakistan had been insisting on constructing a causeway in a low-lying area on its side till the IB, which will be a link with the bridge being established on the Indian side. A causeway, which is basically a road supported by earth or stone, does not allow water to pass under it because there would have been no space. In contrast, officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and Ceigall India Limited, a Ludhiana-based firm mandated with the corridor construction, have been demanding that a bridge should be established as it would allow the free flow of the Ravi water. The issue was first discussed a few months ago when BR Sharma, Special Secretary (Border Management), Ministry of Home Affairs, visited the corridor site.

As such, a farmer has to pay just Rs 10,000 for installing drip irrigation in the fields.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); He said against the target of establishing drip irrigation on 100 acres in the district for maize crop, they have already received applications from 68 farmers to install this system on 114 acres. He added that apart from maize, the farmers could also cultivate cotton, sugarcane and horticultural crops using this technique, which consumes far less water than the traditional flood irrigation system. Meanwhile, Dr Jaswinder Singh Brar, Plant Protection Officer of Moga, said, “With the drip irrigation system farmers can irrigate an acre in just 30 minutes, which not only conserves water but also increases crop yield.” He added, “With drip irrigation the chances of diseases in crops are very less. Besides, the drip irrigation system supplies water as per the requirement and also prevents the growth of weeds in the crops.” He said using drip irrigation farmers need not spray fertilisers separately. They just need to put fertiliser in a compartment provided in the system, which automatically dissolves the fertiliser in water while irrigating the fields. Pritpal Singh, a farmer of Badhni Kalan village who registered himself to install the system on his four acres, said, “Maize requires less water and he is hopeful that this technique of conserving water will give good produce as per studies conducted by agro-scientists.” The Agriculture Department has achieved the target of bringing 2,500 hectares in the district under maize cultivation this year."
"Jupinderjit Singh Tribune News Service Chandigarh, July 8 Accusing the Akalis of trying to divide Sikhs on party lines by organising parallel functions of 550th anniversary celebrations of Guru Nanak, Cooperation and Jails Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, who is head of Kartarpur Development Project, claimed that Pakistan had completed more than 70 per cent of work, while India was still lagging behind with just about 30 per cent completion. In an interview with The Tribune, Randhawa said the SAD and the BJP-led Central government were trying to spoil the work done by Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on the project as well as organising celebration functions jointly with the SGPC under the aegis of Akal Takht. He took on SAD president Sukhbir Badal for recently accusing Pakistan of trying to delay the project. “We had met Akal Takht Jathedar and the SGPC management requesting them to organise joint celebrations. The SGPC and the government had issued a joint statement to this effect also, but Sukhbir took a delegation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to invite him without taking the state government into confidence. It is sad that politicians are trying to score political brownie points over the pious occasion,” he said.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Officials from India and Pakistan are meeting on July 14 to discuss the modalities of the project.  “We want to take people of all faiths along in the celebrations, but we are saddened by the politics being played over the issue.

We also want the number of visitors to be at least 5,000 instead of 700 limit announced by Pakistan,” he said. There was also an issue about flooding of Dera Baba Nanak due to construction on Pakistan side for the Kartarpur corridor. “The water of Ujh river in Pakistan might be diverted to India and flood Dera Baba Nanak in case of heavy rains. We have taken precautionary measures by strengthening the bandh on our side. We want Pakistan to take equal measures. We hope the Indian officials will raise this issue in July 14 meeting,” Randhawa added. About the project  In November 2018, India and Pakistan agreed to set up a corridor linking Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan’s Kartarpur, the final resting place of Guru Nanak Dev, to Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur. The corridor is expected to provide visa-free access to Sikh pilgrims to the gurdwara in Kartarpur Sahib, a small town in Narowal, 4 km from the Indo-Pak border, where Guru Nanak spent the last 18 years of his life.

"Aman Sood Tribune News Service Patiala, July 7 Before the onset of every monsoon, villagers residing along the banks of the Ghaggar, a seasonal river, ensure that they have enough stock of ration and drinking water in case of floods. The Ghaggar terrorises hundreds of villages along its banks in three districts of Punjab. With the Irrigation Department yet to complete the repair of its banks and de-silting work, the villagers are on their toes fearing floods. It has been termed as the ‘River of sorrow’ due to the occasional floods it has caused in the past over a decade. Monsoon rains expected this week onwards have left the residents of nearby villages along the banks of the Ghaggar a worried lot. While the water level is below the danger mark as of now, villagers fear worst if it rains more in the coming few days. Villagers say that the work in certain areas is still to be carried out and in case of rising water level, fields and villages will bear the brunt. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });Floods during heavy monsoon are a regular norm in these areas with loss to both life and property after heavy inflow of water in the Ghaggar, which then floods nearby villages. While the district administration and Irrigation Department have started some de-silting work to clear its bed, heavy rains in the hills, coupled with illegal encroachments alongside its banks, are hampering the work. “We are never safe living here (near Ghaggar), but there is nothing much we can do other than crib. Politicians have come, announced to solve the problem many times but nothing concrete has been done. Floods can spoil our lives anytime during monsoon,” said Gurpreet Singh, a resident of Samana. “While Haryana has raised a concrete wall to save its villages, Punjab needs to do something similar to save its residents. The fear of floods always looms large on all the villages and in case of heavy rains, the damage would be too much to deal with,” he said. Flowing from the Shivalik hills, this seasonal river passes through the districts of Patiala, Sangrur and Mansa, where it causes maximum damage during monsoonal floods. In 2010, floods by this river had caused a huge loss to thousands of residents in Patiala and Sangrur. Already the Deputy Commissioners of Patiala and Sangrur are on toes to ensure that the 2010 situation is not repeated and work to clean the riverbed and strengthen its banks is on at full swing. “We have made ample arrangements to tackle any kind of situation in case of floods. I am personally supervising the last-minute repairs and essential works. The Irrigation Department was told in advance and they have taken ample steps to save our villages from floods,” said Patiala DC Kumar Amit. Meanwhile, even as the administration claims to have geared up for flood relief works, villagers are already prepared to shift their ration on the first floors of the houses in temporary kitchens. “This is an annual ritual where we shift our belongings and kitchen on the first floor,” said a villager. Irrigation Minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria said instructions had been passed to the Chief Engineer, Canals, for ensuring completion of necessary works in all drains and rivers in Punjab, which were flood-prone.

"Ravi Dhaliwal Tribune News Service Gurdaspur, July 4 The Pakistan government’s insistence on constructing a causeway, instead of a bridge, on its side as a part of the Kartarpur corridor project may indefinitely push back the October 31 deadline to complete the project. The Pakistan government wants to build a 300-m-long causeway over a low-lying area till the border which, in turn, will join the 100-m-long bridge being constructed by India. Officials of the NHAI and Ceigall India Limited, the company contracted to build the corridor, have objected to Pakistan’s proposal saying huge part of the corridor in the Indian territory may see heavy flooding of the Ravi, if a causeway was built. A causeway refers to a roadway which does not allow nautical navigation underneath it while a bridge does. Jeetendra Singh, vice president of the firm, said there was every possibility that flood water would be diverted to the Indian side if a causeway was built.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); “We are at a lower gradient with respect to the Ravi floodplains in Pakistan. So when the Ravi is in spate, the water will flow towards us. A bridge will mean the water will drain out, while a causeway will not allow the drainage. We had told Pakistani officials right at the start that we need to build a bridge adhering to international norms. We have flagged our concerns multiple times, but they have been saying they can only make a causeway. That is not going to work,” he said. The issue is likely to resonate in the technical committee meeting to be held at Wagah border on July 16. An official said Pakistan’s resolve to establish a causeway stems from the fact that the structure could be easily dismantled in the event of an eventuality. “If something drastic happens and the corridor becomes inoperative in future, the causeway can be brought down easily. The very purpose of the corridor stands defeated if it gets flooded,” said the official. Cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, who is supervising the operations in his capacity as Dera Baba Nanak MLA, said he was optimistic that the July 16 meeting would offer a solution. “It is a race against time. I hope technical officials will come up with a viable solution which is suitable to both sides,” he said.  Temple issue resolved   The management committee of the temple, which comes in the right of way of the corridor, held a meeting with Dera Baba Nanak SDM Gursimran Singh and NHAI officials. Since the NHAI has already acquired the outer wall of the temple, officials told the committee members that a new wall would be built which would not come in the way before the acquired wall was demolished. The SDM said proper rituals would be followed when the wall is dismantled. "

Their technical team agreed but was not empowered to make a commitment and said they would revert on the issue If Pakistan does not agree to the proposal, it will defeat the very promise of an all-weather road from Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur here to Dera Baba Nanak Sahib in Kartarpur, Pakistan.

"Lahore, March 20 As Pakistan and India discuss the alignment of the Kartarpur corridor, some 600 villagers who are facing “forcible eviction” due to the project say they will block the development work if denied compensation of their land on commercial rates. The entire population (600) of village Kothay Khurd, where Gurdwara Dera Sahib Kartarpur is located (some 125-km from Lahore), has been ordered by the district administration to vacate their houses immediately for the development of the Kartarpur corridor to facilitate the Sikh pilgrims from India. “My ancestors had settled in the village even before the partition and now our fifth generation is living here. Some officials came here and told the residents that the government was planning to build Kartarpur corridor on our land, therefore we will have to vacate the land,” Mohammad Arshad of Kothay Khurd told reporters. “We are living in the area for centuries and it was not possible for us to leave the area and the graves of our ancestors,” another villager Zaeem Hussain said, adding that the government officials had only told them that they would be compensated after their land and houses had been acquired. Hussain said there has been consensus among the villagers to sacrifice their agricultural land but none of them is ready to leave their ancestral houses.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); He said the villagers will protest and not let the government develop the corridor if it forcibly evicted them from their houses. “We want compensation of our land on commercial rates,” he demanded. The Pakistan Kissan Rabita Committee has demanded immediate compensation for farmers on commercial rates. It said no ordinary compensation would be accepted and the affected families be given one job each. Deputy Commissioner Waheed Asghar says the government is acquiring the land under Section 4 of the Punjab Land Acquisition Act 1894 and it will pay compensation for the crop and land. He denied that the government was forcefully evicting the villagers. “We are trying to resolve the matter peacefully,” he added. Evacuee Trust Property Board spokesman Asif Hashmi told PTI that almost 40 per cent of the development work on the Kartarpur corridor has been completed. “The development work on the corridor is underway and will be completed well ahead of this November to observe the 550 birth anniversary of Baba Guru Nanak,” Hashmi said. Experts from India and Pakistan on Tuesday held a meeting to discuss the alignment of the Kartarpur border-crossing corridor project. Both sides jointly surveyed the coordinates of the zero point and discussed technical aspects including finished road level, high flood level, etc. Zero point is the point at which the Indian side of the corridor and the Pakistani side of the corridor will be meeting. The two sides agreed on some technical aspects and hope to finalise other modalities soon. The next meeting is to be held at Wagah on April 2. The meeting had come amid heightened tensions between the two neighbours following India’s air strike on a terrorist training camp of the Jaish-e-Mohammed and Pakistan’s subsequent retaliation. Last November, India and Pakistan agreed to set up the border crossing linking Gurudwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur, the final resting place of Sikh faith’s founder Guru Nanak Dev, to Dera Baba Nanak shrine in India’s Gurdaspur district. Kartarpur Sahib is located in Pakistan’s Narowal district across the river Ravi, about four km from the Dera Baba Nanak shrine. Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu and Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had on November 26 last year laid the foundation stone of the Kartarpur corridor in Gurdaspur district. Two days later, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan laid the foundation stone of the corridor in Narowal. PTI"
"Saurabh Malik Tribune News Service Chandigarh, February 25 The Punjab and Haryana High Court today directed the state to refund approximately Rs 37 crore to contractors declared successful bidders in auction of minor minerals, but unable to start operations following cancellation of environmental clearance by the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA). Justice Mahesh Grover and Justice Lalit Batra set four-week deadline for the purpose. The payment was held back for almost two years. The directions came on a petition by Sukhwinder Singh and other contractors through a battery of lawyers, including senior advocate Gurminder Singh, Mansur Ali and RPS Bara. The Bench was told that the contractors were the highest bidders in the auction for mining quarries on lease in Jalandhar district. They deposited around Rs 37 crores as security and first instalment in accordance with the conditions of auction notification. After examining the matter, the SEIAA found environmental clearance was obtained by the government on the basis of wrong facts as flood protection embankments and dams were within the mining areas. It revoked the clearance granted in the department’s name.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The government approached the appellate authority against the SEIAA decision, but remained unsuccessful. An appeal before the NGT was also dismissed. Aggrieved, the contractors approached the High Court for refund.

It was also argued that the clearance was a precondition for allotment and mining of quarries. Once revoked, the government had no right to withhold the amount of the contractors."

"Vibha Sharma Tribune News Service New Delhi, January 1 A blanket testing of hand pumps/tube wells, especially private ones, should be the first step in dealing with public health issues due to arsenic exposure in Punjab, a recent study on the Indus Basin region, covering Indian as well as Pakistani areas, has said.  Besides, the Punjab Government needs to concentrate more on northern parts which have “serious” levels of arsenic, along with traces of fluoride and nitrate, in groundwater, said Dr Chander Kumar Singh from the Department of Energy and Environment at the TERI School of Advanced Studies. The presence of arsenic in groundwater is mostly “natural, from geogenic sources” and prevalent in Indus as well as the Bengal basin. In fact, it extends to most South Asian countries and several studies have been conducted on problem in the past three decades, including mitigation and reducing exposure. According to Dr Chander, this study, covering 13,000 water sources on the Indian side, is the “first large-scale study of this nature”.  Twenty-five researchers, including 15 from India, participated in the research— conducted by Delhi-based TERI in collaboration with Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, and Columbia University of New York— on 30,000 hand pumps/ tube wells on both sides of the border. “The issue needs immediate attention whether by the way of piped water or community RO systems. The question is whether the mitigation is targeted towards affected areas because we found that the majority of RO systems are installed in southern parts whereas high arsenic levels were found to be confined to flood plains of the Ravi river covering Tarn Taran, Amristsar and Gurdaspur districts,” Dr Chander, who is the lead researcher of the study, said.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); “What the government needs to do is to focus on these areas, test all hand pumps/ tube wells and not just those installed by it. Normally, the government only focuses on its facilities and private wells are not tested. But we see a ray of hope in testing each and every well, including private ones. It costs just Rs 20 per test,” he said. The study found that 87 per cent of households that had hand pumps high in arsenic also had access to private hand pump with cleaner water within 100 m. Normally, in a village of 90 to 100 households (on an average), there would be as many tube wells/hand pumps, but the government would be testing only eight to 10 installed by it. “Mitigation is only possible if you know the exact level and location of the problem. A similar study in the arsenic-affected region of Bihar found that approximately one-third of the population with high arsenic switched to safe wells in the vicinity as a result of blanket testing,” he said. “Deep wells in Punjab do not look promising in terms of solution as some of these have also been found to have high arsenic levels. We foresee the centralised systems of treated water supply/centralised RO systems as a probable long-term solution, but this should be based on the blanket testing of wells along with proper  maintenance.” Indo-Pak Research 30,000 hand pumps/wells under study in India, Pakistan 13,000 water sources on the Indian side under study 25 researchers, including 15 from India, conducted the study Health concerns  High arsenic levels in water are leading to slow poisoning, potentially causing skin lesions, damage to nervous system, stomach ailments, diabetes, renal toxicity, cardiovascular diseases and cancer Because of high fluoride content in water, kids are facing dental and skeletal fluorosis, while high nitrate levels are causing gastric cancer, goitre and birth malformations "
"Aman Sood Tribune news service Patiala, November 25 Almost a year after they were first released into the Beas, gharials have “finally adapted to the new surroundings”. This was observed after the first post-monsoon survey.  The gharial hatchlings had been brought to Punjab from Morena (Madhya Pradesh). The survey was jointly conducted by the Department of Forest and Wildlife Preservation, Punjab and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)-India, along the 90-km stretch of the Beas, starting from Hargobindpur in Hoshiarpur district to Harike Headworks in Tarn Taran. A field survey was conducted from November 20 to 23 by a team of six experts led by Gitanjali Kanwar, coordinator, WWF-India.  (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });As per the survey report accessed by The Tribune, 23 gharials were directly sighted by the field team along the surveyed stretch from Hargobindpur in Hoshiarpur to Harike headworks in Tarn Taran. The survey shows that the gharials have spread across the river and have moved both upstream and downstream of their release sites. The first batch of gharials was released at Gagdewal village while two batches of gharials were later released at Wazir Bhullar village.  Capt Amarinder Singh had initiated the project during his first stint as Chief Minister from 2002-07.  Kuldip Kumar, Chief Conservator of Forests, Wildlife, and Chief Wildlife Warden of Punjab, said the Beas and its aquatic biodiversity, especially gharials and dolphins, had experienced the molasses spill in May and heavy rainfall and high flood levels in September and October. “However, it is satisfying to see that more than 50 per cent population of gharials was directly sighted in the survey. The gharials have spread across the river, chosen a safe habitat for them, stabilised and adapted to local conditions,” he said.  The department also plans to increase the infrastructure and purchase other advanced equipment to better understand the ecology of aquatic animals at the Beas Conservation Reserve. Gitanjali Kanwar said the gharials were spotted basking on the mid-channel islands and quickly dispersed into water when approached. The gharials were active and showed no sign of sluggishness. “Observations showed that gharials have grown in size. Many were reported on the same islands which they selected as their habitat before the onset of monsoon,” she said. "

Amritsar MP Gurjit Aujla, who is in possession of the blueprint, said many NGOs, the prominent being the USM, had been working behind the scenes to ensure the thoroughfare became a reality. Aujla is a member of the parliamentary standing committee on external affairs. The USM has urged both Pakistan and Indian governments to follow its design. The blueprint envisages that the thoroughfare should be named “Kartarpur Sahib Marg — Peace Corridor” and should have a security fence.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); “Since most of the corridor will be in the flood plain, minimum 24-inch diameter cross drains will be provided under the pavement at intervals of 100 ft to facilitate water movement under the pavement in flood-like conditions,” reads the blueprint. As the corridor has to cross two waterways, the Ravi and a nullah just adjacent to Kartarpur Sahib shrine, two 40-ft wide multi-span structures, having similar designs and using the same materials, have been proposed. This will ensure two lanes of traffic and a sidewalk on one side. A decorative metal railing will also be provided on both sides of the bridges with light poles installed after every 100 ft. The design speaks of constructing a 400-ft-long bridge over the nullah, while the Ravi bridge is sought to be 1,200 ft long. Aujla said it would not be a bad idea if the two governments take into consideration the blueprint while establishing the corridor. Two welcome centres buildings, one on the Indian side and the other in Pakistan, are proposed to be built. There is also a stipulation for a walkway to be constructed with an 8-inch thick asphalt base with a 2-inch thick bituminous wearing course so that it is suitable for two-wheeler traffic. The blueprint also indicates a large congregation hall to the south-west of the existing gurdwara building to accommodate 2,000 pilgrims."

A senior officer in the department said Rs 25 crore would be spent on routine works related to the cleanliness and de-silting works, whereas Rs7 crore would be kept reserved to tackle any emergency. He said Muktsar district, which is the worst affected by waterlogging, would get just about Rs 3-4 crore for the entire works. “However, during the previous SAD-BJP government, the district was getting a lion’s share of Rs 12-15 crore. Now, only small drains will be cleaned and that too will be first prioritised,” said a department official.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); He said as per rules, the cleanliness work has to be completed before the onset of the rainy season. “However, this year, the work will get delayed by a few days as the tendering process will also take some time,” he said. Meanwhile, Sanjiv Gupta, Superintending Engineer, Ferozepur, said, “I am supervising some districts, including Ferozepur, Faridkot, Moga, partly Muktsar, Fazilka and Barnala districts. A major portion of the Sutlej flows in Ferozepur district thus we have to take huge flood control measures here. In other districts, there is some problem of waterlogging. We are expected to get about Rs 4 crore for the measures to be taken for the rainy season. The tenders will be floated in the next few days and the work will be hopefully started in the beginning of the next month. We will try to finish the work by the end of July.” Similarly, Gurdial Singh, Superintending Engineer, Gidderbaha Circle, said, “We are expected to get about Rs 3 crore for all works related to rains in Gidderbaha, Lambi, Abohar, partly Muktsar, Abohar and Fazilka. Our priority will be to clean small drains choked with wild growth as the big drains have little water-carrying capacity. We have floated the tenders for these works. Besides, our own machinery will be pressed into service in two days.” Notably, the rains had caused a huge loss in Muktsar district in 2013. Further, some drains have faulty designs and they often overflow. Sources claimed waterlogging in Abohar might damage the kinnow orchards if it rained heavily as the department was short of funds."
"Balwant Garg Tribune News Service Faridkot, May 1 Inaugurating a measles-rubella vaccine drive, in which nearly 73.50 lakh children between 9 months and 15 years will be vaccinated in schools and primary health centres in the state, Health and Family Welfare Minister Brahm Mohindra on Tuesday warned of legal action against those sending messages advising people to boycott the drive. During the week before its launch, the drive is rocked by rumours and fake alerts. “We have got reports that there has been a flood of messages on the social media urging parents not to send their children to schools for vaccination,” said the minister.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); It was an anti-social and misleading activity by people with vested interests, he said, warning of action against such persons. However, the fake alerts on social media, which include texts and audio clips, made a perceptible impact on the first day of the drive. Most of the government schools in the district recorded low attendance on Tuesday. The attendance of students was 20 to 30 per cent less in schools. Some parents also reached school to ask teachers not to administer vaccine to their children. The Health Department on Tuesday organised MR vaccination camps in schools. Saying that about 9,000 children were given vaccination in the district on Tuesday, Rajinder Kumar, Civil Surgeon, Faridkot, said the Health Department teams faced difficulty in some villages due to these rumours. The impact of rumours was more in rural and slum areas. At Government Primary School, Pacca village, 26 of the total 132 students remained absent. At Government Middle School, Sanjay Nagar, Faridkot, 33 students of total 125 did not attend the school. At government school in Bazigar Basti, where 24 of total 184 students remained absent, over 30 parents reached the school, asking the authorities not to vaccinate their children. Many parents even gave in writing, disapproving of vaccination. The minister urged parents to come forward and get their children vaccinated and help the nation achieve the goal of measles elimination and rubella control. “For this mammoth exercise, we have trained 56,974 health staff and volunteers and 48,983 teachers,” he said. Kids fall sick in Bathinda In Bathinda, just after being vaccinated during a drive launched at Shaheed Sipahi Sandeep Singh Senior Secondary School, the condition of a few students deteriorated. A 14-year-old girl student of the school fainted and was admitted to hospital. She was discharged in the afternoon. At least five other students experienced minor health issues. Nine children fell sick (experiencing dizziness and breathlessness) after being administered the vaccine at Government Senior Secondary School, Nangal Kalan, Mansa. Thin attendance in schools According to reports in Muktsar, a majority of parents kept their wards away from schools to avoid the vaccination drive. Navdeep Singh Sukhi, head, Government Primary School, Bhullar village, said: Now, we are not only spreading awareness among them but also giving assurances that the vaccination will not do any harm to their kids. I have pasted a handwritten poster on the boundary wall of my school assuring the parents that I would be responsible in case vaccination goes wrong. Still people are making so many queries."" Officials forced to leave In Moga, parents refused to get their wards vaccinated. The teams of health department, which went to the government schools at Lopo, Chand Nawan, Ghal Kalan, Singhawala and many other villages in the district faced resistance from people. At Government Primary School, Lopo village, parents gathered outside the school and stopped the health officials from vaccinating the children and forced them to leave."
"Tribune News Service Sangrur, April 23 The utilisation of a grant of Rs 45.79 lakh on the repairs of a sub-canal passing through Dhuri city during the tenure of the previous SAD-BJP government has come under scanner. The embankment of the sub-canal had initially developed cracks and sometime ago, a portion of it got damaged due to the water current. As residents complained about the use of poor quality material in the repair work, Dhuri Congress MLA Dalvir Singh Goldy on Monday demanded a high-level inquiry into the matter. After complaints of lack of repair and cleaning, the then SAD-BJP government had approved Rs 62 lakh for the purpose in 2015. However, it released only Rs 45.79 lakh and a contractor from Ludhiana was hired for the repair and cleaning of the canal. A 3-km stretch between Dhuri Truck Union to the Sangrur bypass was repaired in 2016. Residents alleged that owing to the shoddy work, a portion of the canal initially developed cracks. It damaged later, forcing the authorities to place sand bags to prevent a breach. They said the canal required repairs at other places too.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Kulwant Singh, a local resident, said, “The sub-canal passes through the city and may flood it in case of a breach. It needs to be repaired immediately.” Goldy alleged that substandard material was used in the repairs of the canal and the officials concerned misappropriated a huge portion of the Rs 45.79 lakh grant released by the government. “I will take up the matter with the senior authorities and ask them to order a high-level inquiry into the use of the entire grant and take strict action against officers indicted in the probe,” said Goldy. Sukhjit Singh, SDO, Irrigation, Dhuri, said the repair work was conducted as per the specifications. “I have brought the matter into the notice of my seniors that the canal needed repairs,” he said."
"Kuljit Bains Much as the ground water crisis caused by agriculture in Punjab is discussed and well documented, there is another crisis no less serious, and perhaps with graver consequences in the short run, brewing in the state. Poisoning of our waters  in rivers, in ground, and on the surface through household effluents released untreated. Under immediate threat is the health of the states residents in the present day as well as that of future generations through chemical residues permeating into the ground. The Tribune reported last week a shocking practice of a village (Ramuwala Daliawali, Faridkot) having bored a 260-foot deep hole in the ground and injecting sewage into it. Their simple explanation is there is no other option, as the village pond is also not capable of handling the wastewater. Earlier there have been reports of even some industries doing the same with their effluents surreptitiously on their premises. The consequences over the long term cannot be hard to imagine. And there is no saying where all this practice may be in use. The reason behind this is misgovernance and lack of foresight on the part of the government, and irresponsibility combined with greed of the public. Over the past decade most villages have been connected to piped water supply under various projects. It was a necessity, and therefore not something a government would delay for the sake of mere planning, especially when money came from international agencies. That was the first step of the recipe for disaster. The state was about to start pumping out water in untold quantities, to be ultimately drained into a system that was designed decades ago to handle water coming from mere hand-pumps. Essentially, a system meant to handle a trickle, has been overwhelmed by a flood. Next is the ultimate destination of this water, which in most cases was the village pond. But not only village ponds have been encroached upon or are ill-maintained, they also do not have the capacity to contain even a fraction of the water being generated. Thus it is a double jeopardy of there being no drainage to carry the water, as well as no managed end disposal. The result is streets and ponds overflowing with sewage. While this is for the infrastructure designed to create havoc, an aspect that is promoting irresponsible behavior on the part of village residents is the tariff system. They are required to pay a very small fixed amount for the water, with no bar on how much they consume. Having paid the amount, most believe it is their right to take as much as they want. The result is reckless use, whether to wash courtyards or clothes, or simply not turning off a tap. The need is to implement a metered charge, even if the amount only be nominal. That will encourage responsibility.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); While several villages have reported higher incidence of disease, there is a parallel excess happening in urban areas, which is destroying our rivers. The huge amounts of sewage generated in towns is being released untreated into water channels and rivers. There are 87 sewage treatment plants (STPs) in 67 cities and towns, but only 15 of them are releasing acceptably clean water, according to official data. As many as 99 towns are listed as having no STP. But there is a fundamental deficiency in even the ambition of the proposals. And that is the assumption that only urban areas need STPs. Villages need them as much. Wherever there is public supply of water, there has to be a treatment plant, size being proportional to the amount of water drained. As of today there would be no data on the quantities involved, or any study to correlate the sewage situation to cases of illness. Even if the government begins in the right earnest today, it will be not be before at least a decade that villages may get the drains and STPs required. This is a project that cannot be launched a day too soon. The present generation is leaving a huge financial debt on the next; but the debt of health is one that even loans will not be able to repay."
"Ravi DhaliwalTribune News ServiceBatala, April 15Keeping in view the deteriorating sanitation and drinking water supply in the steel town of Batala, a Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) has joined the administration in setting things on the right track.A delegation of the SEWA met SDM Rohit Gupta and urged him to let the women workers join the administration in improving the living conditions in the city.Sunanda Dixit, co-ordinator of the Punjab unit of SEWA, said 77 groups, known as Mahila Arogya Samitis (MAS), had been formed in the town. Batala has been specifically chosen because of the appalling sanitation in Gandhi camp area, which is one of the biggest slums of Gurdaspur district.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });It is pertinent to mention here that 42 people (22 officially) died in Gandhi camp area in 2012 after gastroenteritis broke out. The then chief minister Parkash Singh Badal had personally visited the area in the aftermath of the outbreak and had ordered officials to immediately relay the decade-old sewerage and drinking water pipes. However, that was not done following which an outbreak of water-borne diseases occurs almost every year in the rainy season.“We had the Gandhi camp outbreak in mind when we decided to ask the administration to let us extend a helping hand. The SDM agreed to involve the MAS workers in specific areas of the town where living conditions are really awful. We work under the National Health Mission. MAS form a crucial interface between the residents and health institutions. Each MAS comprises of nearly a dozen women,” said Sunanda.She added that emphasis would also be laid on cleaning the Hansli canal which runs through the inner parts of the town.“Hansli, a storm water drain, which has proved a lifeline for people every time a flood hits the town, has become a victim of apathy. Silt and plastic bags do not allow for the free flow of water. Hence, whenever there is heavy shower, it overflows leading to chaotic conditions in the town. MAS workers will co-ordinate civic authorities to clean the drain,” said Sunanda Dixit."
"Abohar, March 31 Three youths were killed when the motorcycle they were riding, while returning to their native Pakki Tibbi village, hit a roadside tree on the highway, about 8 km from Abohar, on Friday night. Preliminary investigation reportedly indicated that Surinder Kumar (22), his brother Shashi (20) and a friend Jagga Singh (18) worked at a furniture workshop here. None of them was wearing a helmet. Witnesses said the youth, who was driving the bike, lost control after being distracted by flood lights being used by a vehicle coming from the opposite side. The speeding bike hit a tree. They were declared brought dead by the staff on emergency duty at the Civil Hospital here. Shashi was soon to be engaged. Jagga was main breadwinner for his family. Local MLA Arun Narang visited the Civil Hospital and consoled relatives of the deceased. Biker dies in mishap A farmer, Nirmal Singh (60) of Jhurarkhera village, died and his son Amarjit Singh (35) was grievously injured as their motorcycle collided with an oil tanker on the city bypass here on Saturday afternoon. The father-son duo were returning home after purchasing books and stationary items for their wards from Abohar on Monday. Doctors at the Civil Hospital referred Amarjit to a Faridkot hospital. The body of Nirmal Singh was kept at a mortuary for a post-mortem examination. — OC(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });"
"CMO: Advisers more handful than handy For any state government, the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) is the nerve centre, working to strengthen the Cabinet and executive processes on behalf of the Chief Minister and his ministers. During the Congress government’s first year in Punjab, though, the nerves were a bit overexcited, with a rush of signalling in every direction. Much energy was spent on controlling bushfires in the CMO, which ignited even as Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh attempted to put together a team of officers, with an edge over the political class. The tussle between the bureaucrats in the team and the politician lobby kept the pot of intrigue boiling. A point of boil-over was reached when Chief Principal Secretary to the CM Suresh Kumar was asked to be removed from the position by the High Court. Till the time a Division Bench order restored Suresh Kumar in the role, the CMO saw a lull that proved how crucial the bureaucrat was to the functioning of the office. The episode, however, left the ‘palace intrigues’ against the officer an open secret. The alleged role of a close political aide — who had stood by Capt Amarinder Singh while Akalis were in power for 10 years — and two senior bureaucrats in playing the games, of course, gave the Opposition ammunition to attack the government. Ultimately, the Chief Minister had to speak up for his man, and silence all talk, at least for now. The resignation of Power Minister Rana Gurjit Singh over sand-mining taint was the other setback the government, and the Chief Minister personally, faced. The clash of interests among the swarm of advisers around Capt Amarinder Singh was quite plain as the CMO driven by bureaucracy put a check on their ambitions. There is a subtle resentment among the political advisers and OSDs. The situation has also led to the charge from within the party that due political representation is missing in the decision-making process. Party leaders, after all, have come to power after 10 years!(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Though not officially, political advisers have been told to stick to their brief of assisting the CM on issues other than the running of the government. They are thus now seen only when the Chief Minister visits the CMO to attend Cabinet meetings. ‘Restoring people’s confidence in govt’ Punjab’s transformation and progress on all fronts, and the success of my government in restoring the confidence of the people, is our biggest achievement. And it is not just the ordinary citizens who are now feeling more secure, thanks to the marked improvement in law and order, but also the investors whose confidence has been revived. The elimination of gangsters and cracking of targeted-killing cases are significant accomplishments of the police. On agriculture, too, successive smooth procurement seasons are a sign of things looking up. Coupled with loan waiver and our thrust on diversification, there is a lot of positivity visible. Transparency, resulting from the crackdown on various mafias, as well as e-governance initiatives, are notable successes. — Capt Amarinder Singh, Chief Minister  FINANCE White Paper and red entries What’s done  A White Paper on the economy, as promised, has been brought out. Efforts are on to request the Government of India to re-examine the settlement of legacy food credit bill of Rs 31,000 crore that is eating away a major chunk of state finances. Austerity in government/cost-cutting initiatives have been taken. Most offices housed in rented accommodation have been shifted to government buildings. Some departments have been merged to cut administrative costs.  What remains  The government is yet to get a grip on the state of finances. It has defaulted on paying salaries on time twice this year, in spite of 14 per cent increase in the state revenue since the GST rollout. The White Paper revealed the “fiscal misdoings” of the previous Akali-BJP government, but no action for future has been suggested in the document. The Centre seems unwilling to relook at the settlement of food credit account, which is giving ulcers to the state’s financial managers. Unpaid bills, carried forward from the last fiscal, halt to disbursal of social security pensions, and delay in paying out grants to match the Centre’s contribution for several schemes have led to widespread resentment among people.  Sarkarspeak We inherited the economy in a very bad state. But we have taken steps to rectify the faults created by our predecessors. We have been able to cut losses in the food account by Rs 1,000 crore, from Rs 1,800 crore we were spending each year. The state’s revenues have also increased by Rs 1,100 crore. We ensured that the state finances did not avail the overdraft facility for very long, as was done during the previous government’s tenure. This helped us save several crores of rupees. — Manpreet Singh Badal, Finance Minister  SAND MINING As clock ticks, reputation slips What’s done  Capt Amarinder Singh government should be credited for using simple economics — increasing the supply of minor minerals (sand and gravel) to bring down the cost of these basic construction materials. Even though the temptation of getting a finger in the sand-mining pie claimed the ministership of Rana Gurjit Singh and threatens to unsettle Charanjit Singh Channi too, the prices of sand and gravel have come down by almost Rs 3,000-5,000 per 900 cubic ft (one tipper). Certain corrections in the mining policy were later introduced to ensure greater transparency in the bidding process. Changed from ‘reverse bidding’ to ‘progressive bidding’ for the auction of quarries, which helped the government increase its revenue from these auctions. Capt Amarinder Singh, through repeated encouragement to officials to act against all, including his own partymen, has sought to send out the signal that he won’t come to the rescue of those hobnobbing with the sand mafia.  What remains  An Intelligence report is learnt to have informed the Chief Minister that 32 Congress MLAs have stakes in sand mining. The biggest challenge before the government is to ensure that the ministers and all Congress MLAs stay away from the sand mining mafia. The public perception is strongly against the government. The names of at least 11 MLAs, including a sitting minister and a senior elected functionary in the government, are being mentioned in this context openly.  The memory that it was public perception that hurt the previous government the most should be a cause of worry.  Sarkarspeak The crackdown is already yielding results and will continue till the mafia is wiped out. There will be no compromise. For the first time in over a decade, this message has percolated down the rank and file. I have also told the civil officials and the police in categorical terms that they have to go after the big fish too and not confine action to small fry. We have to ensure that the revenue generated from the mining business finds its way to the state exchequer instead of going into the pockets of the corrupt. Already, there is a marked increase in the revenue generation. For the period April 2017 to December 2018, the revenue from mining increased to Rs 117 crore from Rs 42 crore in FY 2016-17, and is expected to increase further by the end of the fiscal. — Capt Amarinder Singh, who holds the charge of mining department  AGRICULTURE Tale of drop in the ocean What’s done  Small steps have been taken to ameliorate the suffering of indebted farmers through a crop-loan waiver scheme. After three years, the state managed to ensure smooth procurement of both wheat and paddy.  After several years, the State Advised Price (SAP) for sugarcane was raised by Rs 10 per quintal. Action taken to ensure quality control on supply of pesticides, insecticides and seeds.  What remains  The crop-loan waiver scheme has drawn more flak than generate goodwill for the government. After several exclusions, only a small percentage of farmers will get a waiver of up to Rs 2 lakh on crop loans. Farmer suicides have continued unabated, with some estimates saying over 400 indebted farmers have ended their life since the Congress government took over. No concrete action plan presented as yet for either ameliorating the economic condition of farmers or towards diversification of crops grown in the state.  Sarkarspeak We have created the right environment which will pave the way for achieving our targets. Apart from the process of farm loan waiver, which we have started in the right earnest as an urgent measure to alleviate the woes of the farmers, we are also looking at long-term initiatives for the revival of the farming sector. We are moving aggressively towards crop diversification, which, coupled with our initiatives to streamline irrigation facilities, will go a long way towards making our farmers self-reliant. We are incentivising farmers to go for crop diversification through various measures, including 80 per cent subsidy on drip irrigation as well as subsidy on the use of solar power for agriculture. We’ve also provided Rs 3.19 crore from the rural development fund for cotton. — Capt Amarinder Singh, who holds the charge of agriculture  EDUCATION Lessons in staffing What’s done  Despite opposition from anganwari workers, the department has gone ahead with its programme of pre-primary education in 13,000 government schools. The aim was to tap children before they joined private schools. The department hopes to get services of at least 1,500 teachers under the Cabinet-approved rationalisation policy, without any distinction between various categories of teacher. School principals will also take 12 classes/month (15 for headmasters). Strong efforts to check mass copying during annual examinations. Private schools have come under special scrutiny. Special cadre of teachers created for border areas by offering them perks.  What remains  Students suffering due to irregular supply of mid-day meals, textbooks, uniforms, etc, besides non-release of funds for post-matric scholarships. Centre has released only Rs 286.26 crore out of its due share of Rs 683.46 crore till date under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA). Computerisation in primary schools remains a distant dream, besides missing classrooms and furniture. Offer to pay only a fixed amount of Rs 10,300 per month to teachers working at higher scales for the past several years as a condition for regularisation of service has generated a lot of bad blood.  Sarkarspeak Reforms don’t occur overnight, particularly when teacher organisations are holding ‘dharnas’ against our reforms. Anomalies in 19 service rules were addressed recently. Leaders complaining about shortage of teachers in villages are often the ones who come looking for easy transfers for kin. Our changes are aimed at better education for our children. It will take some time, but the initial results will start showing soon. — Aruna Chaudhary, Education Minister  ENVIRONMENT Solutions, all on paper What’s done  $1 million “Paddy Straw Management Challenge Fund” announced for whoever finds a solution to the problem. Increased monitoring of straw burning through satellites and field functionaries, plus awareness campaign. Govt employees and panchayats ordered not to burn paddy straw in their fields. Deal with Chennai-based firm to set up 400 plants to convert crop residue into bio-energy. Each plant to have capacity to process 50,000 tonnes/year. Government re-notifies over 21,000 acres of eco-fragile land around Chandigarh under the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA) 1900. This includes 3,725 acre of Siswan village, where Capt Amarinder Singh has bought land. Fencing of forest areas begins; 1,000-acre forestland freed from encroachments. Hunting permits eased Wood-based industrial park proposed. A Rs 650-cr project, fully funded by the Centre, approved for providing machinery like Happy Seeder and bailing rigs to farmers for paddy straw management. Funds will be available in 2018-19.  What remains  State’s demand for a bonus of Rs 100 per quintal of paddy for farmers who do not burn straw not met yet. Only 85 of 165 cities in Punjab have sewage treatment plants (STPs). Though constructed under the previous government, only a handful are working. Untreated sewage flows into drains and rivers. Of 50 towns identified for discharging effluents into the Beas, Sutlej and Ghaggar rivers, only 28 have set up STPs. Monitoring is woefully inadequate. Nothing substantial done on policy to increase forest cover. Though some action has been taken against illicit felling, forest mafia is yet to catch necessary attention of the government.  Sarkarspeak The government is going all out to check water, air and noise pollution, especially the issue of burning paddy straw. We undertook a mammoth exercise of regular monitoring of incidents of fire in the fields. — KS Pannu, Chairman, Punjab Pollution Control Board  HEALTH On pills and prayers What’s done  Punjab became first state to launch 240 ‘health and wellness centres’. Part of plan for 2,950 such centres. Launched a mobile food-testing lab to check adulterated food. Also started online inspection and sampling system to expedite testing. To eliminate TB by 2025, Punjab launched a free X-ray service to diagnose patients in all government hospitals. Biometric attendance for staff in all government hospitals.  What remains  Work not started on promise of developing all primary health centres and community health centres as independent multi-specialty hospitals. In its manifesto, the Congress promised five new medical colleges. However, even the foundation stone of medical college approved for Mohali by the previous government has not been laid. Three existing government medical colleges remain in pathetic condition. No district hospital could get diagnostic equipment such as MRI, CT-Scan. The Clinical Establishment Act, which aims to regulate the functioning of private hospitals, yet to be implemented. Draft gathering dust for five years.  Sarkarspeak In 10 years of SAD-BJP rule, they purchased the equipment, but didn’t think of hiring people to operate them; they built buildings for hospitals and de-addiction centres, but didn’t hire human resource for them. After one year, I am still trying to clear the mess I have inherited. — Brahm Mohindra, Health Minister  DRUGS Over the high, far from clean What’s done  In the very first Cabinet meeting on March 18 last year, a Special Task Force (STF) was constituted to “wipe out” the scourge of drugs from the state within four weeks. Over the past year, the Punjab Police arrested 13,880 persons in 12,546 cases registered under the NDPS Act. Similarly, 1,473 persons were arrested by the STF in 939 cases registered under the NDPS Act. Some initial arrests by STF exposed the nexus between police and drug dealers; it also led to the arrest of a few policemen. Availability of drugs on ground has reduced, but completely wiping out drugs may be a goal too far. To cover every village, the government introduced 26 ‘Outpatient Opioid Assisted Treatment’ centres in three districts — Amritsar, Tarn Taran and Moga. At these centres, around 3,000 patients have been treated.  What remains  The STF too seems to be succumbing to the internal politics of police, as it has become a parallel power centre. Fast-track district courts were promised to decide NDPS cases within 30 days. Nothing has happened. A promised review of around 45,000 cases registered mainly against drug users over the past decade has not been done. The SAD-BJP government spent around Rs 100 crore on building drug de-addiction centres, but this government has done precious little to get addicts to these centres. On the other hand, private centres are overflowing. As per a recent pan-Punjab study by the PGI, there are over 3 lakh people who were dependent on banned drugs in the state. Allegations of drugs making their way into jails keep haunting the government.  Sarkarspeak The STF is coordinating implementation of the EDP (enforcement-deaddiction-prevention) model. District police and the STF have registered cases against 12,780 offenders under the NDPS Act between March 16, 2017, and February 28, 2018. Steps are also being taken to attach and confiscate the properties of drug smugglers. A proposal for preventive detention under the Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act is at an advanced stage with the government. The Outpatient Opioid Assisted Treatment (OOAT) model to provide services to addicts to reduce consumption is being implemented by the Health Department. Prevention aspect is being approached with a long-term perspective by focusing on students. Alongside, the Drug Abuse Prevention Officer (DAPO) programme — to be launched later this month — focuses at the community level in localities. The aim is to ensure maximum results at the minimal cost to the state. — Harpreet Sidhu, head, special task force  INDUSTRY Struggling, block by block What’s done  The government unveiled a new industrial policy in November 2017, wherein “thrust” sectors like high-tech manufacturing, technical textiles, and food processing were exempted from State GST. The Congress had promised the policy would come within 90 days of assuming office, but it took seven months. A Rs 100-crore fund was created to promote a “start-up culture” to provide entrepreneurs with “world class” facilities. MoU signed for setting up a start-up in the STPI’s incubation centre in Mohali, where the state has proposed to set up India’s largest govt-supported “Startup Hub”.  One-time settlement policy introduced for the loanees of the Punjab State Industrial Development Corporation. Electricity tariff for the existing and new industry was fixed at Rs 5 per unit (excluding other charges) from January 1, 2018.  What remains  The government launched the industrial policy in November 2017, but it is yet to introduce the operational guidelines for the policy. Attracting actual big-ticket investment remains a challenge, even as the CM has signed MoUs with various industry houses. Start-ups in the state are yet to get funding, as announced by the Chief Minister under the Start-up Policy. Lower power tariff has been provided only to industry, keeping out the services sector (IT/ITES/BPO). Even for industry the cost becomes Rs 6.5 to Rs 6.7 per unit after levy of charges and duties, not Rs 5 as promised. Plug-in system for start-ups is yet to see the light of day. Freight equalisation incentives yet to be introduced. It is required as Punjab is very far from the major ports from where raw material comes, which makes it uncompetitive. Finished goods also have to be sent out over great distances.  Sarkarspeak On being asked by an IT industry representative about the electricity tariff parity for them with the manufacturing sector, Capt Amarinder Singh promised to examine the matter. He was addressing industry members at TieCon 2018. The operational guidelines of the Industry Policy-2017 are just a provisional formality, and will be placed before the next Cabinet meeting for approval. — DPS Kharbanda, Director, Industry & Commerce  TRANSPORT Old driver, new wheels What’s done  Controversial and allegedly pro-Akali State Transport Commissioner Harmel Singh, whose writ ran unquestioned for years, removed. The new Transport Policy promised in the manifesto was notified just a few days before the completion of one year of the government.  What remains  No end to a flood of litigation on the route permits, bus time-table issues, extension of route permits, favouritism to a few transporters. Incumbent STC gave directions based on High Court orders regarding the transport business, but went beyond the court directions, resulting in fresh litigation and stay on new initiatives. Even the new Transport Policy is awaiting court clearance. Monopoly of the Badal family on the bus transport sector has not only continued but gained strength. They are buying more buses and route permits. Share of the government buses — of PRTC and Punjab Roadways — has gone down in new Transport Policy — from 75 to 50 per cent on national-highway routes and 60 to 40 per cent on state highways/district roads. Bus time-tables made by previous govt to allegedly favour Badal family buses remain unchanged.  Service to people remains poor.

"Vijay Mohan Tribune News Service Chandigarh, November 17 Nineteen sites have been identified for setting up a system to monitor water discharge in rivers and streams of Punjab under the National Hydrology Project (NHP), besides five sites where automatic weather stations (AWS) would be installed. It is envisaged that the NHP will improve reservoir operations by providing optimal dam filling and release schedules through timely and reliable data acquisition, storage, collation and management of water resources. This would result in releasing greater quantities of water for hydroelectric power generation, irrigation, drinking and industrial supply. According to studies, additional hydroelectric power generation from the NHP in Punjab is expected to be around 40 MW, resulting in an annual incremental benefit of Rs11.8 crore. The additional availability of water for irrigation, drinking and industrial production is assumed to be 4.7, 0.5 and 5.1 million cubic metres, respectively, with a combined annual incremental benefit of over Rs24.2 crore.

This includes Rs3,640 crore for the NHP and Rs39.76 crore for the National Water Informatics Centre. The World Bank approved funding for the project earlier this year. The NHP is being implemented in several states. In Punjab, eight discharge monitoring sites will be set up on the Ravi, Sutlej, Beas, Ghaggar and Chakki rivers in Pathankot, Ludhiana, Ferozepur, Patiala and Gurdaspur districts and the rest would be on various choes or rivulets in Hoshiarpur and Mohali districts. The AWS would come up at Pathankot, Khanna, Mansa, Gidderbaha and Abohar. Several monitoring sites and weather stations in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh are also being set up by the Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB). These sites would provide real-time information on hydro-meteorological parameters such as the quantum of rain or snow in the catchments of rivers, the rate of melt, speed of water flow, silt level and time and quantity of water expected to reach the reservoirs. This data is expected to help in flood control. The NHP is a nationwide version of two successful smaller and independent projects, Hydrology Project-I and II, that covered the Krishna and Sutlej-Beas basins to provide real-time weather forecast and flood warnings.

But this mostly remains meaningless, as often the relief is Rs 5,000, or even smaller amounts, paid by the state government for losses of up to Rs 40,000-50,000 per acre. The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) was touted as a radical solution for its beneficiaries by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Ground realities, however, reveal that it has turned out to be another money-spinner dished out by insurance companies, facilitated by the government. Farmers of Punjab say they had no say in the formulation of the policy so crucial to them.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); THE PUNJAB EXPERIENCE Thus far, Punjab, Sikkim, Manipur and Nagaland have not implemented the PMFBY, while it is operational or will be soon in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Odisha, Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Assam. Old-timers like Bishan Singh and Bachan Singh of Khaira Dona village in Kapurthala district recall that farmers have been the losers in all farm insurance schemes implemented by the Centre since the Individual Approach Basis Scheme was launched in 1972. They have memories of the ‘great flood’ of 1962 and the pittance received as compensation. A few rupees, some blankets, but no “insurance”. Officially, nearly 20 per cent of the cropped area was damaged in floods that year as compared to 13 per cent and 10 per cent in 2009 (15 dead) and 1988 (200 dead), respectively. In well-irrigated Punjab, those were the heady days of the Green Revolution (paddy was recording an increase of 5.30 per cent per annum), whereas most of the insurance schemes were tailor-made for rain-fed agriculture of many other states. The Comprehensive Crop Insurance Scheme (CCIS- 1985) focused largely on drought, whereas the state’s farmers wanted only insurance for hailstorm but with higher indemnity. Successive governments – both the SAD and the Congress – over the decades only paid lip service on this count. Policies were framed, scrapped and re-framed, but turned out to be just old wine in fancy new bottles each time, says BS Rajewal of the BKU. WHY PMFBY DOESN’T WORK In its present avatar, the major flaw in the farm insurance scheme is that it comes into play only if there is 40 per cent crop damage in a village, which is counted as a single unit for availing any relief, says Rajewal. First, farmers want that instead of being village-specific, the scheme should be farm plot-specific, with crop indemnity (compensation) levels above 95 per cent. Secondly, farmers demand that the 10-year benchmark for assessing ‘normal’ yield levels while deciding on the insurance premium should be scrapped, and the latest yield should be taken into account. The premium should also be standardised to 1 per cent for all crops, as crop losses in Punjab are very low as compared to the rest of the country. Thirdly, the crop lying in market yards should also be covered. At present, only the harvested crop in the fields lies within the ambit of the scheme. Largely mechanised harvesting operations and relatively easy access to markets in Punjab ensure that the crop reaches mandis within hours. Hence, it needs protection from the vagaries of weather in the mandi, where it may await procurement for days. In view of stiff opposition by the peasantry and farmer unions, the scheme has been given a quiet burial by the state government. In a meeting on this issue with senior officials of the Union Agriculture Ministry and the insurance companies a couple of years ago, Rajewal says he asked if the rationale of the entire village being a single unit was applied to vehicles or life insurance. Would the company only settle claims if 40 people died or 40 vehicles were involved in a pile-up? Needless to say, that was the end of it, he added. Haryana implemented the scheme and its farmers have alleged that the insurance companies collected over Rs 750 crore in premium, but only disbursed Rs 112 crore as compensation. The matter was even raised in Parliament, Rajewal claims. KEEP ARHTIYA OUT Buta Singh Burj Gill, president of the BKU (Dakaunda), too minces no words in denouncing the scheme in its present form as anti-farmer and pro-corporate. We desperately need insurance but not at these costs and terms, he added. There are no takers for even premiums heavily subsidised by the Centre and the states (in equal proportion). Farmers pay 2 per cent of the premium for kharif crops, 1.5 per cent for rabi and 5 per cent for horticulture crops. On an average, a farmer has to pay Rs 800 per acre for rabi and kharif crops and Rs 1,250 per acre for cotton as premium. They are not able to bear that cost. The need is to scrap the arhtiya system. The money/profits collected by this system under the present procurement arrangement can be used to pay the PMFBY premium, saving both farmers and the government this recurring fiscal burden once and for all, Gill suggests. The Mandi Board is equipped to buy the produce from the farmers, and everyone would be more than willing to clean the crop, weigh it and transport it to the nearest state godown. This would not only provide employment to the landless labourers, but also mean an additional income for the farmers on freight charges, he pointed out. As it is, farmers transport the produce to the mandis. When the government knows that the farmers are fiscally distressed and committing suicides, why burden them with another life-long liability, asks Gill. UNRESPONSIVE STATE GOVTS Punjab’s reluctance to implement the PMFBY also drew the attention of Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh, who told the Rajya Sabha recently that the state should seriously consider implementing the scheme as it had neither sent a draft for drought relief nor done crop insurance in the past five years. “I have seen the record of the state; Punjab’s farmers do not go in for crop insurance. But during drought, even a request for relief was not made to us,” he added. Under the PMFBY, there would be no upper limit on the subsidy provided by the Centre or the state. “Even if the balance premium (after farmers’ contribution) is 90 per cent, it will be borne by the government,” according to an official. In previous schemes, the premium had been capped, which resulted in low claims being paid to farmers. This was done to limit the government outgo on the premium subsidy. “This has been removed. Farmers will get the claim against the full sum insured without any deductions,” the official says. Another benefit of the PMFBY is that losses incurred from the sowing stage to the post-harvest season would all be covered. Earlier, only post-harvest losses could be offset. Farmers who haven’t availed bank loans would also be eligible for insurance cover. Solution in guaranteed income; production, market risk both coverED While farmer unions have been agitating for implementing the MS Swaminathan Commission recommendations and bureaucrats are clueless on what to do, a report by Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, in 2014 suggested that a study of all insurance schemes since 1974 till date had revealed that opting for the Farm Income Insurance Scheme (FIIS-2003-04) would be the best bet for Punjab. As this is the sole scheme covering both production and market risk, it could also be used for giving a boost to the flagging diversification drive of the state, the PAU study observed. It envisages targeting two critical components that decides a farmer’s income — yield and price — through a single policy instrument by ensuring a “minimum guaranteed income” determined by using the average yield for the previous seven years and the MSP. If the actual income falls short of the guaranteed sum, the farmer would be eligible for compensation to the extent of indemnity from the Agricultural Insurance Company (AIC) of India."
"New Delhi, August 6  Foodgrain output in the ongoing kharif season is likely to surpass last year’s record of 138.04 million tonnes due to higher acreage and good monsoon for the second straight year, Agriculture Secretary Shobhana K Pattanayak said today. So far, more than 80 per cent of the sowing of kharif crops — paddy, pulses, oilseeds, cotton, sugarcane and jute — has been completed and the planting would continue in some parts till next month, Pattanayak said. About 19 lakh hectare of crop area has been affected by floods across the country and farmers are likely to take up other kharif crops once the water recedes, he said, expressing concern about poor rain in some parts of Karnataka. While there were floods in some states, there was a drought-like situation in parts of Karnataka, Pattanayak said, adding that there had still been close to 3 per cent jump in the acreage under kharif crops so far. Pattanayak said farmers in flood-hit areas would replant other crops in 19 lakh hectare once the water receded. Till last week, farmers had sown kharif crops on 878.23 lakh hectares as against 855.85 lakh in the year-ago period, as per the Agriculture Ministry’s latest data.

He said the overall acreage for all pulses is higher, except tur. With regard to cash crops, he said the overall area sown to cotton and sugarcane was higher than last year so far. Cotton acreage has increased to 114.34 lakh hectare so far in the 2017-18 kharif season from 96.48 lakh in the year-ago period on account of good rain and better prices. — PTI "

"Tribune News Service Chandigarh, August 1 The Irrigation Department got only Rs 40 crore this year against the estimated expenditure of Rs 350 crore on its preparedness for the rains. It is another matter that the state has so far not received enough rain that creates an emergency situation. But with the Met Department predicting heavy rain across the state this week, things may get worse as many susceptible points have been left unguarded due to lack of funds. The department in its ‘Flood Preparedness Memorandum-2017’ had sought at least Rs 350 crore. It has already spent Rs 30 crore on strengthening vulnerable points in the water distribution system — canals, rivers and drains. Karan Bir Singh Sidhu, Special Chief Secretary (Revenue and Irrigation), said: “Besides strengthening the flood-prone irrigation channels, we have kept an amount of Rs 10 lakh each at the disposal of all deputy commissioners for emergency expenditure in case of floods.

"Sanjeev Singh Bariana Tribune News Service Chandigarh, July 30 Punjab may have to pay a price in terms of flooding in many areas as a consequence of the unearthing of alleged scams in the government, which diverted the attention of the Irrigation Ministry, and the Assembly elections earlier this year. The distractions pushed to the backburner certain crucial yearly measures required to prevent floods. A meeting of the Flood Control Committee, which is supposed to be held in January, took place only in April because of the Assembly elections, which delayed the steps required for preparedness. The department issued maintenance tenders as late as June 2 for the amount that was sanctioned on May 25. Another indication of the matter having been ignored is that only 140 of the 850 drains in the state have been cleaned, and merely 36 of the 296 vulnerable spots identified along rivers have received approval for strengthening works. Most such spots have been left out as the government sanctioned only Rs 40 crore to the Irrigation Department for flood management. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The comprehensive Flood Preparedness Memorandum-2017 had sought at least Rs 350 crore. Last year, the SAD-BJP government had released Rs 132 crore. Adding to the worries is 5,000 employees of the Irrigation Department who are in mood for agitation over the Vigilance Bureau making inquiries in multiple cases against engineers and officials. Chief Engineer (Irrigation) AK Bansal said, “Our department has spent approximately Rs 30 crore of the sanctioned amount and the ‘danger areas’ have been adequately strengthened. The remaining Rs 10 crore has been kept aside for exigencies during the monsoon.” Fortifying bundhs Harvinder Singh Sohal, SE (Drainage), says the department has spent Rs 5.8 crore on bundh strengthening along 250 km of the Sutlej and Beas. “This amount has been spent in Kapurthala, Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, Ludhiana and Nawanshahr. Machhiwara block and Nawanshahr along the Sutlej and Sultanpur Lodhi along the Beas are the most vulnerable areas this time,” he says. However, Jaswant Singh of Hussainpur Bule village, whose fields are about 4 km from the bundh, says, “There has been no desilting of the riverbed for the past many years. My paddy crop was washed away in 2012.” Jagjit Singh of Sangra village says, “Since our land falls within the Dhussi Bundh, our paddy crop is damaged every year. There is no one to warn or help us.” Paramjit Singh, another farmer from Passan Kadim village, near Baupur Mand, also alleges there has been no desilting. “They just throw sandbags on the grassy banks in the name of bundh strengthening. As a safeguard, we have raised the plinth of our houses by 10-15 feet,” he says. Ghaggar threat The Ghaggar floods Moonak and Khanauri tehsils at regular intervals. In Khanauri, three identified points cause the maximum devastation. Yet, farmers allege, the authorities wake up only when the monsoons are already upon them. The Drainage Department had sent a proposal for Rs 17.36 crore for Patiala, Mohali and Fatehgarh Sahib districts, but only Rs 2 crore was cleared. There are several rivulets and drains in the area, but only the Jacob drain and the Vaddi Nadi have been cleaned. Clogged drains This is one of the districts where no drain has been cleaned for want of funds. Work on one project on the Beas in the Bet area is underway. Why does it flood  Most damage in Punjab due to floods is caused by the Ravi, Sutlej and Ghaggar, which have a common delta where floodwaters meet; and if in spate simultaneously, these rivers can wreak havoc. The silt deposited by the rivers in the delta area raises bed levels, causing overflow. According to the Punjab Disaster Management Action plan, intense rainfall, inadequate drainage, lack of maintenance of flood control and other works (embankments, drainage system, cross drainage works) aggravate the flood situation.  (Inputs by Parvesh Sharma, Harinder Singh Khaira and Deepkamal Kaur)"

"Rachna Khaira Tribune News Service Jalandhar/New Delhi, February 13 Lakhs of people, including 20,000 Punjabis residing in US counties of Oroville, Butte and Sutter in northern California, were asked to evacuate on Monday by the local authorities after the emergency spillway of the Oroville Dam developed cracks resulting in release of water from the lake. Lake Oroville, 150 miles northeast of San Francisco, is one of California's largest manmade lakes, and the 770-ft Oroville Dam is the tallest in the US. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); (Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd) The lake is a central piece of California's government-run water delivery network, supplying water for agriculture in the Central Valley and residents and businesses in southern California. According to Jaswant Singh Bains, president of Yuba City Gurdwara, the evacuation announcement was made around 6.30 am (local time) on Sunday when huge number of devotees was present in the gurdwara to pay obeisance on ‘sangrand’. Read: Lakhs told to evacuate as spillway at California dam on verge of collapse  “The sudden announcement created a panic amongst the devotees. We quickly wrapped up the programme and asked them to return to their homes,” Bains said. He added that though evacuation was only recommended in Yuba City, around 20,000 Punjabis got stuck in the three counties where the evacuation was ordered following the potential threat of uncontrolled flood waters flowing down to low-lying areas. According to Surinder Mehta, a resident in Butte County, the evacuation announcement was made several times. “They kept on announcing repeatedly that it is not a drill and the area residents should move to safer places,” Mehta told The Tribune over phone. He said though the damage to the spillway was reported around four days ago, it was only late Sunday night that the evacuation was ordered. The emergency spillway was rated to handle 250,000 cubic feet per second water. However, water began flowing over the emergency spillway on Saturday for the first time in its nearly 50-year history after heavy rainfall. Unexpected erosion chewed through the main spillway earlier this week, sending chunks of concrete flying and creating a 200-ft long and 30-ft deep hole. Meanwhile, centres were set up at various places in Chico, Paradise and Silver Dollars fairground in Butte County to accommodate area residents in case the flood waters spill over the county.  Law enforcement agencies, infrastructure maintenance personnel, health and emergency service providers have rushed to the affected areas to help people in distress. Butte jail inmates, too, were evacuated following the potential threat of flood in the area. According to Satnam Chahal, chairperson North American Punjabi Association (NAPA) whose volunteers are helping evacuees in affected area, the threat seemed to have declined a little.  “The helicopters kept on depositing the rocks filled with containers throughout the day to strengthen the potential fatal points on the spillway. Also, the water level inside the reservoir has decreased considerably,” said Chahal.  Though gurdwaras in the areas have planned to shift ‘Swaroops’ to safer places, they have now postponed the plans till next announcement, he added. Meanwhile, the local county administrations are updating the evacuees on their official Facebook page and even providing immediate respite to those who got stuck during the evacuation. Gurdwaras offering food, shelter to affected  Gurdwaras in Sacramento, California, are offering food and shelter to all the residents evacuated from the Yuba City, following fears of the Oroville Dam collapsing. “Sikh temples in Sacramento offering Food & Shelter. They are open for ALL people evacuated from Yuba City #OrovilleDam #OrovilleSpillway,” tweeted social activist, Harjinder S Kukreja. Yuba County Office of Emergency Services posted an evacuation order on Facebook saying, “Yes, an evacuation has been ordered. All Yuba County on the valley floor. The auxiliary spillway is close to failing. Please travel safely. Contact family and friends. Help the elderly. Take only routes to the east, south, or west. DO NOT TRAVEL NORTH TOWARD OROVILLE!!!!!”    The California Department of Water Resources also issued an emergency evacuation order on Facebook that reads, “Officials are anticipating a failure of the Auxiliary Spillway at Oroville Dam within the next 60 minutes. Residents of Oroville should evacuate in a northward direction, toward Chico. Other cities should follow the orders of their local law enforcement.”   The National Weather Service has issued a flash flood warning for a possible dam failure. The areas that can be affected are Oroville, Palermo, Gridley, Thermalito, South Oroville, Oroville Dam, Oroville East and Wyandotte. — With agency inputs"

"Kulwinder Sandhu Tribune News Service Moga, January 30 Akali heavyweight and Agriculture Minister Jathedar Tota Singh is locked in a tough contest with Congress candidate Kaka Sukhjit Singh Lohgarh and AAP nominee Daljit Singh Sadarpura in the Dharamkot constituency of Moga district. Kaka is trying to cash in on anti-incumbency against the SAD-BJP government.

"Aman Sood Tribune news service Samana, January 16 Residents of hundreds of villages situated alongside the Ghaggar are fed up with the “false” promises made by leaders of various political parties over the past 25 years. Before every election, leaders come and promise that a mechanism will be put in place to check devastation caused by Ghaggar floods, but all those promises have remained unfulfilled, they say. While no solution has been worked out to tame the Ghaggar flood fury, the river has now turned into a hub of cancer spread by water pollution that has reached alarming proportions. Residents of remote Hashanpur Mangta village in the Samana constituency say the Ghaggar has become a “river of sorrow” for them. Neither the Shiromani Akali Dal nor the Congress has done anything for them, they allege. “We have no option but to drink polluted Ghaggar water, use it for irrigation and feed cattle.

The only words Congress and SAD leaders say on the issue is that they “have done everything possible and now the Centre must ensure more funds”. Originating from the Shivalik hills in Himachal Pradesh, the Ghaggar meanders though several districts of Punjab and Haryana to flow into Rajasthan from where it enters Pakistan. Embankments have come up and the riverbed dug up and widened at certain places, bringing some relief to the people of Sangrur and Patiala constituencies. “We are happy at the erection of embankments, but it is not a permanent solution. The Ghaggar fury became a poll issue for the first time around 20 years ago, but no permanent solution could be worked out to it so far,” says Mehal Singh from Dharmherhi village. Villagers allege the Punjab Pollution Control Board has miserably failed to check direct discharge of effluents from factories and sewage into the Ghaggar. “It is high time that promise-breakers (politicians) are taught a lesson, besides being made to explain why they have failed to find a solution to the problem so far,” villagers say."

"Sarbjit Dhaliwal Tribune News Service Chandigarh, March 3 The legal validity of the Punjab Termination of Agreements Act, 2004 is not only the case being faced by the state with regard to river waters in the Supreme Court and elsewhere. There is virtually a mountain of cases burdening the state since decades. In fact, for the past about five decades or since its reorganization in 1966, Punjab is knotted in a maze of legal battles. On sharing of river waters and on the issue of the control of certain head works, not only Haryana but Rajasthan is also a litigant against Punjab. Likewise, Punjab had also filed cases on various matters related to the distribution of river waters and attendant issues. The failure of the Centre to resolve the inter-state issues over the years has kept states, especially Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan busy in litigation at various High Courts and the Supreme Court. Not only in court, the state witnessed a long bout of violent agitation which took a fierce turn on the issue of SYL construction in the early 80’s.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The Presidential Reference regarding the Punjab Termination of the Agreements Act, 2004, is listed for next hearing on March 8. All water sharing agreements with the neighboring states were terminated by passing a law when Capt Amarinder Singh was CM in 2004. Because of this measure, the process to complete the construction of the SYL canal was stalled. Another case that is pending in the SC is a suit praying for the direction to the Union Government to constitute an appropriate Tribunal under Section 4(1) of the Inter-State Water Disputes Act, 1956, to adjudicate the disputes relating to the equitable distribution of Ravi and Beas waters as raised by Punjab in its complaint in January, 2003. One writ petition is pending in the Delhi High Court in which the state has appealed for setting aside the constitution of the Eradi Tribunal. This petition has been adjourned by the High Court till further orders as it is awaiting the decision on the Presidential Reference. Then there are proceedings before the Eradi Tribunal, which are in abeyance in view of the Presidential Reference. A Special Leave Petition is pending in the Apex court against the decision of the Rajasthan High Court pertaining to the handing over the head works of Harike, Ropar and Ferozepur to the BBMB. Another case is with regard to the Hansi-Butana canal in the apex court. The Punjab Government has sought the dismantling of this canal as it has apprehended that the embankments of this canal would block the sheet flow of flood water of the Ghaggar river and Patiala nadi thus submerging vast tract of land in Punjab area. In one case, Punjab has challenged Sections 78 and 79 of the Punjab Reorganization Act, 1966 appealing the Supreme Court to declare these sections ultra vires. There is another case in which Haryana has filed a case regarding the handing over the control of Harike, Ferozepur and Ropar. In another case, Haryana has sought legal right in Thien Dam, Shahpur Kandi Project, UBDC-II, Anandpur Sahib Hydel Channel and Mukerian Hydel and has demanded share in the power generated by these projects. Similar case has been filed by Rajasthan Government. Besides it, there are certain other cases pending for adjudication in courts."

"Praful Chander Nagpal Our Correspondent Fazilka, November 8 Dismayed over the poor price the 1121 basmati paddy variety fetched this season, farmers might not grow the crop next year. They say they would again grow the traditional parmal variety that was sold for higher prices this season. The farmers have asked the Central Government to work out an effective basmati export policy to bail them out. Sources said the average yield of parmal paddy per acre was about 33 quintal this year and its minimum support price (MSP) was Rs 1,450 per quintal. Thus, farmers earn about Rs 47,850 per acre. On the other hand, the average yield per acre for 1121 basmati paddy variety is about 19 quintals, while its price per quintal is Rs 1,650. So the farmers cultivating this variety earn only Rs 31,350 per acre.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); “We will sow parmal paddy in the future as growing basmati proved to be costly,” said farmer Jawinder Singh of Nurpura village, who grew basmati on 8 acres. Moreover, the input cost of cultivating basmati paddy is also higher. “Farmers have to spray pesticide on the basmati crop nearly three times more compared to parmal variety. Besides, the plantation of basmati paddy also costs high,” said farmer Mangal Singh of Jorki Andhewali village. Sources said basmati was sown on 72,000 hectares this year, while parmal on 25,000 hectares in Fazilka district. Over 30 per cent of basmati paddy amounting to 7 lakh quintals arrived in the Fazilka grain market and 16 purchase centres so far. If the farmers switched back to growing parmal variety from next year, it would hit the government’s diversification push. The basmati variety consumes less water, while parmal variety needs flood irrigation. "
"Praful Chander Nagpal  Fazilka, October 11 Rice mill owners have criticised the government’s decision to impose 7 per cent tax on them. Already incurring losses, rice millers fear with the arrival of aromatic fine 1121 variety of basmati in the grain market in a few days the crisis may deepen. “The imposition of tax is likely to affect the equilibrium price of the market driven 1121 variety of paddy as the buying cost will increase. On the other hand, due to geo-political reasons, the prices of basmati rice slashed to 40 per cent last year,” said Ashok Grover, President, Punjab Basmati Rice Millers’ Association. The rice millers purchased paddy on a higher rate and sold rice on lower prices last year, resulting in huge losses to the tune of hundreds of crores of rupees. The imposition of tax has further worsened the situation in the border belt, which is largely dependent on the basmati trade.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The 1121 variety is purchased at a higher rate than the minimum support price of Rs 1,450 per quintal. The private traders are the bulk buyers of the variety. “The farmers are at receiving end. The traders are not going to offer higher rates to the farmers as they will have to shell out 7 per cent extra to the government,” said Navdeep Singh, a farmer in Banwala village. The Punjab Government had waived off market fees and rural development fund two years ago to encourage the diversification to basmati paddy, which consumes less water as compared to parmal that need flood irrigation. The farmers have pleaded that 7 per cent tax is higher as compared to neighbouring state of Haryana, which is geographically in an advantageous position being nearer to Delhi. In Haryana, the traders have to pay only 4 per cent market fees and less transportation expenses to send the material to the national capital and for further sending to gulf countries. The farmers and traders have demanded abrogation of tax to save the economy."

He demanded that the government should construct a ring road with a height of 7 to 8 feet around the village, which would work as a ‘bundh’ and keep the river water from entering residential areas. Jangir Singh Nambardar of Madarpur village said the availability of green fodder for the cattle had become a major problem for those living in the embankment areas because the fodder plants had got submerged in water.  Agriculture Minister Tota Singh, who is also the MLA of this area, said he had asked Health Department officials to pay regular visits to the affected villages and monitor the health of people so as to prevent the spread of diseases. “We will provide free medicines to people,” he said.  Chief Agriculture Officer Dr Jarnail Singh, Agriculture Officer Dr Jaswinder Singh Brar and other agro-scientists have advised people living in the embankment areas to change their cropping pattern to avoid financial losses during waterlogging. He said the cultivation of sugarcane or poplar trees was the best option to escape flood losses.  "

Of these, 885 have been deployed outside the Golden Temple, 663 at reserve and other duty points, 140 at nakas within the city limits and 125 on patrolling duty.  While the police will primarily be looking after security arrangements outside the Golden Temple complex, a large number of SGPC task force members will be deployed in and around Akal Takht to make sure that no incident of violence takes place on the occasion.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });  The police will also be carrying out a drive tonight to verify the antecedents of the pilgrims who are either staying at the SGPC's inns or are sleeping in the ""parikarma"" of the Golden Temple at night.  While there has been no ban on carrying ""kirpan"" for baptised Sikhs inside the Golden Temple complex tomorrow, the police may stop ""suspicious individuals"" whose appearance doesn't conform to Sikh traditions from carrying any weapon inside. Even today heavy police force was deployed at entrance gates of all major holy shrines. A number of policemen have also been deputed in civvies inside the Golden Temple complex.  Significantly, the police and the SGPC officials have closely watched the CCTV footage of the last year's bloody clash at Akal Takht to identify ""mischievous elements"" and to prepare a plan about how to tackle such a situation, if needed.  They also intend to isolate the ""potential troublemakers"" well in advance by identifying them in the CCTV footage. Besides, they have ensured that all CCTV cameras installed around Akal Takht are functioning properly.  The police also carried out a flag march from Hall Gate to Jallianwalla Bagh in the afternoon.  Akal Takht Jathedar Giani Gurbachan Singh again appealed to all Sikh organisations to peacefully observe the anniversary. He clarified that it was only the Akal Takht Jathedar who led the community in paying homage to the ""martyrs"" while delivering his address. ""No other Sikh leader is allowed to address the gathering on the occasion,"" he added.  Meanwhile, the Dal Khalsa reiterated its demand for an international probe into the killings of hundreds of Sikh pilgrims and loot of manuscripts from Sikh Reference library during the Army operation.  Senior leader Satnam Singh said the call for tomorrow's bandh would be peaceful and that the police should not create panic.

He said the Sikh community had put up posters in Punjab and elsewhere in the country in connection with the Operation Bluestar anniversary. ""The posters were also put up in Jammu but a policeman tore it which hurt the sentiments of the Sikhs. The police opened fire on Sikhs when they protested,"" he said, adding that the firing incident had sparked widespread resentment among Sikhs across the globe.

Sikh activists have even put up posters of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale in different parts of the city, including Sheranwala Gate, Dukhnivaran Sahib gurdwara and the Sirhind road.

"Archit Watts Tribune News Service Muktsar, May 28 After facing flak for its alleged failure in controlling flood-like situation every year during the monsoons, the state Irrigation Department has this year developed a software – Punjab Irrigation Work Information System (PIWIS) — to keep an eye on all ongoing works of drainage and other wings of the department. Officials have been told to upload pictures of all ongoing works once every week on the software so that the higher-ups sitting in Chandigarh could monitor the situation. Sources said the access of this software has also been given to Chief Minister’s Office, Chief Secretary and Secretary (Irrigation). An Executive Engineer said the software had started functioning about a fortnight ago, which was developed and maintained by the Irrigation Department itself. About the functioning of this software, he said, “For instance, if the work of cleaning and de-silting of drains is going on somewhere or sub-surface drainage system is being installed, we have to upload three pictures of different angles from the site. It is easy for the higher officials to check the status of the work and give any advice.”(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); He added, “Earlier, we used to send hard copies of status reports of the ongoing works. Now, this software has sped up the pace of work.

Even some people had complained to the Chief Minister in this regard. This software will definitely keep a check on such practices,” added a senior officer of the department. KS Pannu, Secretary (Irrigation), Punjab, said, “The Irrigation Department is a big department having eight chief engineers of different wings. When I took the charge of the department, I found that works were being done by different wings in a disjointed manner without a central command and surveillance. Hence, I deputed newly recruited young engineers to develop software for proper monitoring of works in the department.” “It is now implemented and giving good results. In the days to come, measurement book shall be written online and linked to work monitoring system and automatic bill generation and then linked to state treasury for payments. All inspections will be recorded online,” Pannu added."

"Archit Watts Tribune News Service Muktsar, May 2 The Facebook page of Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Badal, who reportedly owns the Orbit bus company, is flooded with the complaints against his employees. Sukhbir’s Friday’s post, saying “deeply anguished, assuring that no one found guilty would be allowed to escape justice…” does not seem to have gone down well with his followers. A large number of people have given him feedback against the “autocratic” and “ill-behaviour” of conductors and drivers of Orbit buses. Some of them going further have even advised him how to tame his staff. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });Pawan Choudhary, a Facebook user, posted: “Sir, I am from Rajasthan.

"Archit Watts Tribune News Service Muktsar, April 14 The state Irrigation Department has set June 30 deadline to clear drains and undertake other anti-flood measures in various districts of the Malwa belt, particularly Muktsar and Fazilka, that are prone to waterlogging during monsoon. The state government would spend nearly Rs70 crore for the purpose. KS Pannu, Secretary, Irrigation, said, “To ensure that anti-flood works are completed before June 30, the Chief Engineer (Drainage) will camp in Malout for three months. It will be for the first time that any Chief Engineer will camp at a particular site for such a long period. His stint in Malout, which is centrally located for both Muktsar and Fazilka districts, will start from May 1.” Pannu said anti-flood works would include cleaning of the drains, removing obstructions, raising embankments of drains, etc. He said other anti-waterlogging works would be done by spending Rs225 crore. “The most urgent works will be completed before September 30,” he said.

"Archit Watts Tribune News Service Muktsar, April 12 Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal today appealed to the Centre to introduce crop insurance scheme at the earliest, terming it the remedy of all ills plaguing the farming community. Badal demanded that the compensation amount be enhanced to Rs 10,000 per acre for farmers affected by natural calamities. “Besides adequately compensating the farmers for their loss, the Centre must introduce the crop insurance scheme at the earliest to protect the peasantry from the vagaries of the weather,” said Badal during his visit to rain-hit villages in his Lambi Assembly constituency.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); “It is unfortunate that wheat crop over thousands of acres has been damaged due to untimely rain. It has added to the miseries of the farmers who are already reeling under heavy debt. In this hour of crisis, the Centre must swing into action by forming a long-term policy for the farmers,” he said. Badal assured the farmers that he would impress upon the Union Ministers and the officers concerned to take necessary steps so that the interests of the farmers could be safeguarded. He told the farmers that the NDA government had recently revised norms for relief to the distressed farmers. During his visit, the CM reviewed the ongoing work to tackle waterlogging at Rattakhera Vadda and Rattakhera Chhota villages. Both villages have been adopted by him to develop as model villages. Fazilka: The Chief Minister today visited Dhippanwali village to assess damage to crops and property after hailstorm lashed Arniwala block areas of the district yesterday. He interacted with affected farmers to listen to their grievances regarding the loss to their crops. He assured them of every possible help. He also met seepage-affected land owners. He ordered the deputy commissioners of Fazilka and Muktsar to conduct a special girdawari to assess the loss. Villagers told Badal that their crops had been damaged due to seepage, waterlogging and overflowing of village pond. The Chief Minister directed Secretary (Irrigation) to visit waterlogging and seepage-affected areas of Fazilka and Muktsar districts and prepare a comprehensive master plan to tackle the menace. Jagraon: The arrival of wheat is yet to start at Jagraon Grain Market, the second largest grain market in Asia. The arrival has been delayed due to unseasonal rain and hailstorm last month. The crop is not ready for harvesting at most of the places. Not a single farmer has brought his crop for procurement in the grain market. Similar is the situation in the rural grain markets of Jagraon area. Usually the farmers start bringing their crop to the grain markets in the first week of April, but this has not happened this time. ""The procurement starts in the first week of April and picks up pace in the middle of the month, but this time the arrival of wheat is yet to begin. The crop in the area has not ripened yet. The farmers have thus not started harvesting the crop,"" said Rajinder Singh, a commission agent. The authorities of the local administration say they are all set for the procurement. More than 100 purchase centers have been set in Jagraon grain market for smooth procurement of the produce. Rakesh Kumar Popli, Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Jagraon, has already held several meetings with the authorities of the Food and Civil Supplies Department and officials of various procurement agencies to take stock of procurement measures. But no official date for the procurement has been announced so far. ""The next week is going to be hectic for us as wheat arrival would suddenly pick up. Clearing the procured wheat from the grain market will pose a challenge for us,"" said Jaswinder Singh, secretary, Market Committee.

"Aman Sood Tribune News Service Patiala, April 6 Farmers and politicians are on toes against increasing the height of the Bhakra main line canal (BML) embankment near Khanauri in Sangrur by one-and-a-half feet by the Punjab Irrigation Department. The work will “ensure that Haryana gets more water for its tail-end villages”. Haryana will start getting 1,450 cusecs of water from May 1, instead of around 1,050 cusecs that it gets now. The Haryana Government has already paid money for the work to the Punjab Irrigation Department, which is expected to complete the work before April 30. Sources said the Haryana Government had already paid Rs 3.7 crore to the Punjab Government and it was expected to release another Rs 95 lakh to complete the work.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); “The Barwala link canal, which was getting around 1,000 cusecs of water so far, will start getting 1,450 cusecs after the work is completed by the Irrigation Department on the canal that falls in Punjab but belongs to Haryana,” they said. Farmer unions, including the Bharti Kisan Union, have raised the issue of Punjab officers trying to hastily complete the work that will allow more water to Haryana. They alleged efforts were on to pressure Punjab through the Union Government for the release of more water. “The Irrigation Department is not following all norms and we apprehend this will keep fields in Punjab dry as more water will go to Haryana,” they said. Union members said soil was being brought from outside to level the area while many fields near the site could have benefited had the Irrigation Department waited for the wheat crop to be harvested as farmers could have levelled their fields and the department would have saved on soil cost. A senior official confirmed that the work at the project site started a couple of months ago. “This will help the Haryana Irrigation Department to get its due share of 1,450 cusecs,” he said. Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal and Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Badal have been repeatedly claiming that “Punjab will not allow a single drop of water to flow out of the state”. Even today, Sukhbir said at rally that any sacrifice would be small to keep that commitment. “Sar vadya ja sakda hai, par paani da ek vi boond nahi ditta ja sakda (we can sacrifice ourselves, but will not part with a single drop of water)”, he said. People’s Party of Punjab chief Manpreet Singh Badal today questioned Sukhbir on the issue of raising of the embankment of the Bhakra canal by over a foot on a stretch of 7 km (up to Khanauri head). “This will allow additional water to Haryana. What has added to the mystery is the admission by officials working at the site that the raising of the embankment is being funded by Haryana,” he said. The Badal government was under pressure from the Centre to resolve the river water dispute with Haryana, he said. Patiala division BML XEN IS Walia said the completion of work at the BML Khanauri would not mean that excess water would flow to Haryana. Only the legitimate share of water allotted by the Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) would get through, he added. “Haryana will get its 68.3 per cent share, while Rajasthan will get 6.83 per cent. Punjab will continue to get its 25.73 per cent of share. Though the work once completed will allow more water to Haryana, but it will be as per guidelines,” Walia told The Tribune. Moreover, strengthening the embankment would save many Punjab villages from flood threat, he added."
"The complete text of Punjab Finance Minister Parminder Singh Dhindsa's Budget Speech, presented in the state Assembly on Wednesday: (There may be certain discrepancies in the formatting of the matter as reproduced from the text supplied by the Punjab Government) PART A Hon’ble Speaker Sir, It is my privilege to present before this august House, the fourth consecutive Budget of the re-elected Shiromani Akali Dal and Bhartiya Janta Party alliance Government for the year 2015-16. 2.    The world is upbeat about India as her economy has entered a promising era with a series of economic reforms ushered in by the NDA Government at the Centre. As per the IMF and the World Bank’s latest forecasts, India is set to soon become the fastest growing big economy in the world. These times present a unique opportunity to the State of Punjab to uplift its own economy by becoming a key partner in the National economic growth process. I strongly believe that the Shiromani Akali Dal and Bhartiya Janta Party Government led by our most respected leader Sardar Parkash Singh Badal ji and dynamic leader Sardar Sukhbir Singh Badal ji with support of the reform minded NDA Government at the Centre will herald a new dawn for Punjab’s economy.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); 3.    The budget has been prepared against a changed backdrop created by increased devolutions from the 14th Finance Commission and a concomitant reduction in plan transfers to states in the Union Budget. The steps and policies outlined in the Budget for 2015-16 presented by me reflect the commitment of our Government to put the State Economy on the path of sustained high economic growth the benefits of which will reach all sections of the society.  The budget also lays down steps to steer the State towards the 2 course of prudent fiscal consolidation, promote industrial development, revive the agriculture sector and promote all round inclusive development. While we chart the course forPunjab’s economic progress we are mindful of the diverse challenges facing the State like drug abuse, adverse child sex ratio, rising incidence of cancer, fiscal stress and youth unemployment. The Government is making its best efforts to address these challenges and with adequate support from the Centre we will certainly overcome these in a short span of time. 4.    I had made certain commitments while presenting the Budgets for 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15. Our Government has implemented a majority of them while action has been initiated on others. I will dwell upon them while discussing the Budget proposals of the individual Departments. Mr. Speaker Sir, I will now discuss the economic and fiscal parameters of the state in some detail. ECONOMIC GROWTH 5.    As per advance estimates, the GSDP at current prices is estimated to grow at 10.16% in the current fiscal year (2014-15).  During the year 2013-14, the GSDP at constant prices grew at 5.73% against the national growth rate of 4.74%. The per capita income of the State at current prices is also estimated to increase from Rs 92350 in 2013-14 to Rs 99578 in 2014-15 (A). FISCAL CONSOLIDATION 6.    To promote growth by judicious use of scarce resources and 3 to achieve intergenerational equity, fiscal discipline is of utmost importance. The Government is taking all steps to ensure that it ‘Lives within the means‘ and thereby stabilises its debt and deficit position. Before I present the fiscal indicators I am glad to inform the House that the 14th Finance Commission (FC) in its recommendations has increased the share of Punjab in central taxes from 1.389% to 1.577%. I am also happy to share with the august House that the 14th Finance Commission has also recognised the fiscal turnaround of the State due to efforts made by our Government and has therefore removed it from the list of States needing revenue deficit grant. 7.    Now I turn to the success made by the State in achieving fiscal consolidation. Punjab is well within limits of most of the fiscal targets set by the 13th Finance Commission and under the FRBM Act. The Fiscal Deficit came down from 3.45% of GSDP in 2006-07 to 2.77% of GSDP in 2013-14 and is estimated at 2.97% of GSDP in 2014-15 (RE) well within the 13th FC target of 3.0%. For the year 2015-16 (BE), the fiscal deficit of State Government is projected at 2.98% of GSDP. 8.    The diligent efforts of the State Government have enabled it to keep the debt within manageable limits as is reflected in the rapid decline in debt to GSDP ratio. In 2014-15, the Outstanding Debt to GSDP ratio is pegged at 32.27% (RE), well ahead of the target of 38.7% set by 13th FC for the year 2014-15. During 2015-16, the Outstanding Debt to GSDP ratio of the State is projected to be 31.34% of GSDP. 9.    Reduction in revenue deficit remains a challenge for the State Government in the wake of the implementation of the 5th Punjab Pay Commission recommendations which saw a significant increase in its committed expenditure on salaries and pensions. As I will present in the later part of the speech, due to sustained efforts of the Government the own tax revenue to GSDP ratio as also the non tax revenues have increased in the recent years, however declining share of Punjab in central taxes had constrained the overall resource position of the State. This situation though is set to take a better turn now with the latest 14th Finance Commission recommendations which has resulted in increased devolution albeit at the cost of reduced plan allocation. 10.  Realising the importance of own tax revenue in meeting our expenditure needs, the State made sustained efforts to raise its own tax revenue. Consequently, between 2007-08 and 2014-15 (RE) the State’s own tax revenue increased at an average annual growth rate of 16%. 11.  The quality of expenditure incurred by the Government has also improved in the recent years as reflected in the increasing ratio of development expenditure to total expenditure of the State Government. During 2013-14, the percentage of Developmental Expenditure to the total expenditure of the State was 52.24% which substantially improved to 55.39 %in 2014-15(RE). For the year 2015-16 (BE) the ratio of developmental expenditure to total expenditure of the State is budgeted to go up to 55.60%. In addition the capital expenditure of the State Government has witnessed a significant rise of 79% from Rs 2200.61 crore in 2013-14 to Rs 3948.28 crore in 2014-15 (RE). 12.  Before I enter into details of sector-wise budgetary provisions, I would like to summarise at the outset some major new initiatives our Government has proposed for the year 2015-16. The guiding philosophy of ‘Sarbat Da Bhala’ has led us to design these schemes for inclusive development of all the sections of our society. GOOD GOVERNANCE 13.  Sir, I take pride in stating that the assiduous efforts of our Government have made Punjab a leading state in the implementation of e-governance initiatives. One such landmark initiative in citizen centric service delivery is the setting up of Sewa Kendras. Fulfilling our commitment to bring the ‘Government at the Doorstep’ we are establishing Unified Service Centers (Sewa Kendras) in rural and urban areas. 2174 Sewa Kendras will be set up within this year for providing 50 services to the citizens at their doorsteps. Within the next two years, over 200 services will be covered through Sewa Kendras. Rs 500 crore have been earmarked for this purpose. AGRICULTURE 14.  Agriculture is the mainstay of Punjab’s economy, providing livelihood to over 60% of the population in the State. The Government is committed to the growth of this sector with a special emphasis on sustainable agriculture and improvement in the incomes of the farmers. I welcome the Union Government’s budget announcement of setting up Post Graduate Institute of Horticulture Research and Education in Amritsar. Punjab is set to become a leading State in horticulture research and I sincerely hope that the crop diversification process in the State will scale new heights with the establishment of this Institute. 15.  Cooperatives have been playing a crucial role in the development of agriculture and allied sector of Punjab. The sugar cooperatives have successfully contributed to crop diversification in the State by increasing the area under sugarcane. The current falling prices of sugar have caused financial difficulties to the cooperatives, making it difficult for them to pay the farmers on time. I have therefore allocated Rs 600 crore for support to sugar cooperatives for making timely payments to cane growers. I have also made an allocation of Rs 80 crore for recapitalisation of Central Cooperative Banks in order to further strengthen them to increase their lending for agriculture. INDUSTRY 16.  Sir, the micro and small enterprises have made a significant contribution to the overall development of the manufacturing sector in the State. Punjab has a significant presence of micro and small enterprises which are potential ‘engines of growth and inclusive development’. These units deserve all encouragement given the huge employment potential they offer. To alleviate the financing difficulties faced by micro and small entrepreneurs, I propose to launch an ‘Entrepreneurship Development Programme’ for a period of five years. Under this programme an interest subvention at the rate of 3% will be provided on loan taken to set up a micro or small enterprise with investment of up to Rs 5 crore. For the year 2015-16 an allocation of Rs 100 crore has been provided for the scheme. 17.  The recent economic downturn also affected our industry adversely and many borrowers from PSIDC, PFC and PAIC are facing genuine difficulty in repaying their loans. With a view to bringing the blocked industrial investment into productive use and to revive the existing Punjab industry, Government is bringing a reasonable OTS Policy for promoted and loanee companies of PSIDC, PFC and PAIC. Under this Policy, besides hundreds of those small scale industrial units, financed by PFC, settling their accounts and getting revived, another 60 large and medium scale industrial projects, besides around 15 industrial projects of PAIC are likely to get revived and PFC, PSIDC and PAIC are expected to effect recovery of significant public monies. YOUTH Skilling Punjab Youth 18.  The future of Punjab lies with the youth which make up almost 30% of the total population of the State. To enhance the employability of youth, our Government is committed to empower them with the right skills in tune with the industry requirements.  Keeping this in view and also the fact that with a significant presence 8 of MSME sector, the State will be a crucial partner in the ‘Make In India’ campaign, the State has set up an empowered ‘State Skill Development Mission’ with three tiers at State, District and Block level. 19.  Under this Mission 22 Multi Skill Development Centres, one in each district is proposed to be set up in a phased manner. In the first phase, centres are being set up at Ludhiana, Amritsar, Bathinda, Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar and Ropar to meet short term skill development needs of the State. The Mission is also in the process of setting up three Skill Development Centres in the Health Sector at Medical Colleges, Amritsar, Patiala and Faridkot. 20.  Under this Mission, I also propose to set up three specialised Skill Development Centres in construction sector in partnership with renowned companies in the construction sector. To provide skill training at their doorsteps, 2000 skill training centres for girls and 500 centres for boys will be opened in villages in the existing infrastructure of Government schools and other buildings at village level when they are not in use. The State Government proposes to spend Rs 200 crore on these initiatives. Higher Education Funding 21.  Sir, to ensure that just for want of funds not a single dream of pursuing higher education of poor students remains unfulfilled, I am glad to propose Education funding for students belonging to blue card holder families securing admission to the Institutes of national importance. SPORTS 22.  Sir, the contribution of Punjabis to the world of sports is widely recognised. It is a matter of great pride that a large number of Punjabis have represented the country in a number of international sports events. To further improve upon the capabilities of Punjabis, to tap the talent at the right time, to train and to create sportspersons of international level and to groom them as medal prospects, our Government has established Punjab Institute of Sports (PIS). Under PIS there will be Centres of Excellence for 12 identified games. Around 6000 sports persons from 14 years of age and onwards will be identified from all over the state and will be trained in these Centres of Excellence created in different parts of the State. The admitted players would be provided free boarding and lodging at the centres, arrangements will be made for their proper education and scientific training under expert Indian & foreign coaches. PIS will have a budget of Rs. 50 crore Annually. 23.  To strengthen the sports infrastructure stadiums, multipurpose stadiums at all district headquaters have been built or upgraded or are being built at a cost of Rs. 320 crore. In this endeavour a multipurpose stadium at Pathankot and Fatehgarh sahib is being built and the Stadium at Barnala is being upgraded.  At the block level, I propose setting up of one block level stadium in each block of the State in the next five years. A hockey stadium will also be constructed at Ferozepur with a cost of Rs. 10.31 crore. URBAN DEVELOPMENT 24.  Urban population constitutes 37% of the total population of the State. Our Government is successfully meeting the challenges of urbanisation through various initiatives. Sir, I put forth yet another proposal to fulfil the dream of providing “affordable housing for all”, that 50,000 Houses for EWS will be constructed in next two years in collaboration with HUDCO and will be allotted to the beneficiaries under the scheme on EMI payable in 20 years. 25.  I also reiterate the commitment of our Government to provide 100% sewerage and water supply coverage in all Municipal and Corporation towns. I am glad to announce the launch of the ‘Punjab Urban Development Mission’ under which 100% water supply, sewerage, STP, Road & Streetlights will be provided in all the cities by the year 2017. RURAL DEVELOPMENT 26.  Despite the accelerated growth of urbanisation, there is no denying the fact that Punjab resides in its villages. “Pinda ch Vasda Punjab”. Development of villages is the top priority of our Government and to take it further I propose to launch the ‘Mukh Mantri Pendu Vikas Yojana’. The scheme envisages comprehensive development of villages through provision of basic amenities. For the current fiscal, a sum of Rs 600 crore has been earmarked for this scheme. WATER SUPPLY & SANITATION 27.  I am pleased to share with the House that the World Bank 11 has approved the 2nd Punjab Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project spread over six years (2015-16 to 2020-21) with a total cost of Rs 2200 crore. The objective of the project is to improve rural water supply and sanitation services and service delivery arrangements in the State. The convergence of the project with Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) would ensure individual toilets for every household in the state by 2018. HEALTH 28.  Sir, I appreciate the Union Government’s decision to set up an AIIMS in Punjab which will further strengthen the healthcare infrastructure in the State. The State Government is setting up Medicity near Mullanpur in Mohali, which will house many of the best known names in healthcare. I also propose to support the medical health insurance scheme, the “Bhagat Puran Singh Sehat Bima Yojana”, which will provide cashless medical treatment through smart cards to 30 lakh Blue Card Holder families in addition to 4.50 lakh BPL families. This scheme will provide protection to around 1.50 crore population of economically weaker households from financial liabilities arising out of health shocks that involve hospitalization. Hospitalization expenses up to Rs 30,000/- will be met by the Government in empanelled government and private hospitals. An initial provision of Rs 50 crore has been kept in the Annual Budget 2015-16. WOMEN 29.  It is rightly said that “you educate a woman and you educate 12 a generation”. Education is the cornerstone of women empowerment.  Even to this day many of our girl students especially in rural areas miss school for lack of basic facilities like girls toilets. Sir, to ensure that no girl student misses education due to lack of basic facilities in schools, I propose a scheme of ‘Strengthening of Girls Schools’ in Punjab. Under the scheme, 121 Government Girls High schools/senior secondary schools in 144 CD blocks will be strengthened in terms of basic infrastructure. I propose to allocate Rs 20 crore under this scheme for 2015-16. SC WELFARE 30.  Welfare of Scheduled Castes is an integral part of our strategy of inclusive growth. For integrated development of all the villages having SC population of more than 50%, I propose a sum of Rs 45 crore in the year 2015-16 under the Pradhan Mantri Adarsh Gram Yojana. MINORITY WELFARE 31.  Our Government is sensitive to the interests of the minorities in the State. We are committed to their welfare and protection of their interests. Sir, for the year 2015-16, I propose to earmark a sum of Rs 10 crore each for setting up of Muslim and Christian burial grounds in the State. GREEN PUNJAB 32.  Sir, recently the Parliament cleared the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill, recognising battery-powered E-rickshaws as a 13 valid form of commercial transport. The State Government has decided to introduce E Rickshaws in the old Corporation towns in the first phase with the twin objectives of providing employment opportunities to the poor and curb air pollution in the cities. The Government will soon launch a scheme to offer attractive loans to people to buy e-rickshaws. TOURISM & CULTURE 33.  Sir, our Government is deeply committed to properly project and protect the rich cultural heritage of the state, and realize its full potential in Tourism sector. In fulfilment of the vision of our Honourable Chief Minister, the Government is setting up memorials in the memory of important events and personalities. A State of the Art Memorial Jang-e-Azadi in the memory of people of Punjab who participated in the freedom struggle is being set up at Kartarpur. War Memorial cum Museum is coming up at Amritsar.  Guru Ravidass Memorial is being set up at Khuralgarh, in district Hoshiarpur, Bhai Mardana ji Memorial at Ferozepur and Baba Moti Ram Mehra ji Memorial at Fatehgarh Sahib. Bhagwan Balmiki Tirath Sthal (Ram Tirath) at Amritsar is also being redeveloped. Over Rs 500 crore have been earmarked for these initiatives. 34.  Sir, I am pleased to announce that a sum of Rs 500 crore has been provided for carrying out various tourism and culture related works in the Holy city of Amritsar. Some of the major works proposed to be undertaken are construction of entrance plaza in the Forecourt of Shri Harmandir Sahib, Facade improvement of surroundings of Golden Temple, Jallianwala Bagh, town hall and Hall Gate in Amritsar. OTHERS 35.  Sir, it has been decided to establish a Gaushala in every District to take care of stray cattle. To this effect a ‘District Animal Welfare Society’ under the chairmanship of the Deputy Commissioner will be established in every district which will set up the infrastructure for Gaushalas. This initiative will go a long way in protecting the farmers from the damage to crops caused by stray cattle and in preventing fatal accidents caused by them. 36.  To curb the threats posed by stray dogs, I also propose to set up dog pounds in every District to take care of stray dogs. The dog pounds will provide care and shelter to the homeless stray dogs. PART B Sir, now I would like to present the budget proposals in greater detail PLAN SIZE & PERFORMANCE 37.  There has been significant improvement in size of approved Annual Plan of the State and its implementation since 2006-07.  The approved Annual Plan during 2006-07 was Rs 4,000 crore, which increased to Rs 20,100 crore in 2014-15. The implementation of Annual Plan was 65% during 2011-12, 72% during 2012-13 and 73% during 2013-14. The likely financial achievement in 2014-15 is 80%.  The size of the Plan is Rs 21,174 crore for the year 2015-16 with an increase of 5% over the previous year’s plan. The increase in the size of Annual Plan 2015-16 is modest in view of the expected reduction in central assistance. 38.  The Union Government has further restructured the 66 Centrally Sponsored Schemes in to 3 categories i.e. (i) Schemes to be fully supported by Union Government, (ii) Schemes delinked from support of the centre and (iii)Schemes to be run with the changed sharing pattern. The details are awaited from Government of India. AGRICULTURE Crop Husbandry 39.  Punjab has been contributing about 50-60% of wheat and about 35-40% of rice procured by the Government of India for food security of the country for the last four decades. I congratulate the farmers for the record production of wheat in the current Rabi season. During Rabi 2013-14, the production of wheat was 176.20 lakh tonnes out of which 119 lakh tonnes has been procured by the State. In kharif 2014 the production of paddy was 169.62 lakh tonnes against which 121 lakh tonnes has been procured. The free power supplied to the farmers at a cost of about Rs 4,778 crore has proved vital in this regard. The State Government invested Rs 38765 crore for procurement of wheat and paddy in the state in the year 2014-15. Compensation for loss due to natural calamity has been enhanced from Rs 2000 to Rs 5000 per acre. 40.  The crop diversification process in the State is going on successfully. Four maize drying units have been installed and three more units are being set up. A project has been started to mechanize the cotton production system from sowing till picking. Every year, additional area of approximately 4000 hectare is brought under fruits by supplying healthy, disease free plants. Horticulture Development Board is being setup in the state to promote development of Citrus, Guava, Litchi & Pear fruits. Hi-tech vegetable seedlings nurseries are proposed for Patiala, Attari (Amritsar) and Bir Charik (Moga). It is proposed to set-up a multi product mega food park in 200 acres of land at Ladhowal.

"Ruchika M Khanna Tribune News Service Chandigarh, March 18 Punjab Finance Minister Parminder Singh Dhindsa proposed no new taxes as he presented proposals worth Rs 79,314 crore in his fourth consecutive Budget in the Vidhan Sabha today. He, however, failed to outline measures the government will adopt to increase its revenue receipts by Rs 3,486.88 crore for 2015-16.  The effective Budget size for 2015-16 has been pegged at Rs 61,814 crore, with a sum of Rs 17,500 crore being provided for ways and means transactions for the current year. The revenue deficit is much higher this year at Rs 6240.38 crore as against the estimate of Rs 4,252.63 crore mainly because of a decline in growth of revenue receipts. Next year, too, is projected to have a high revenue deficit of Rs 6,393.96 crore.  With the SAD-BJP government already in the election mode, the proposals seem to focus specifically on the rural areas and small businesses — both core vote banks of the two parties.  Taking this into context, the Finance Minister has announced three new initiatives —Rs 100-crore entrepreneurship development programme to provide interest subvention to micro and small industry; Rs 600 crore for support to the sugar industry; and Rs 600-crore Mukh Mantri Pendu Vikas Yojana. But he failed to specify a roadmap for additional resource mobilisation of Rs 1,300 crore to fund these proposals.  The total plan size has gone up from Rs 20,099 crore this year to Rs 21,173.90 crore for the next fiscal. The maximum fund allocation (plan outlay) has been made towards the social services department — Rs 8568.55 crore — which is almost 40.47 per cent of the total plan outlay. Another Rs 3,807.20 crore has been reserved for the power sector; Rs 3,035 crore for transport, Rs 1,723.39 crore for agriculture and allied services, Rs 1,404.86 crore for rural development; and Rs 1,005.31 crore for irrigation and flood channels.  The plan allocation has been increased by Rs 1,929 crore in social services; Rs 758 crore in general economic services (construction of buildings, school and college infrastructure; untied funds of Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister; development of kandi and border area, etc); Rs 500 crore in agriculture; Rs 330 crore in irrigation and flood control; and by Rs 846 crore in the power sector.  The fiscal indicators for the state confirm the worst fears regarding the health of Punjab’s economy. The state’s outstanding debt will mount to Rs 1.24 lakh crore by March 2016, as compared to Rs 1.12 lakh crore during the current financial year.  Servicing of debt alone will take Rs 13,498.48 crore from the total revenues.   The state’s own tax revenue is expected to show an increase of just 2.70 per cent as compared to 2014-15 (Rs 29,351.93 crore in 2015-16 as compared to Rs 28,560.57 crore during the current fiscal), while the revenue receipts are expected to increase from Rs 42,742.36 crore this year to Rs 46,229.264 crore in 2015-16 mainly through increase in states non-tax revenue (increase of Rs 830 crore) and a jump of Rs 2,500 crore as additional share in Central taxes because of the increase in devolution of Central taxes by 10 per cent. Punjab will, however, lose Rs 3,000 crore as revenue deficit grant since it has been removed from the category of revenue deficit states. The fiscal deficit will also increase from Rs 10,397.6 crore to Rs 11,895.15 crore in 2015-16. The revenue expenditure is expected to increase from Rs 48,982.74 crore this year to Rs 52,623.20 crore in 2015-16. The salary and pension bill of the government will increase by Rs 2,188 crore next fiscal. The total subsidy bill of the state will be Rs 6,216 crore, including Rs 5,484 crore towards power; Rs 692 crore for social security pensions; and Rs 40 crore under the Mai Bhago scheme. "
