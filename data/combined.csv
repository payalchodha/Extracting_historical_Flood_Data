even as chief minister capt amarinder singh attempted to put together a team of officers, with an edge over the political class. the tussle between the bureaucrats in the team and the politician lobby kept the pot of intrigue boiling.  a point of boil-over was reached when chief principal secretary to the cm suresh kumar was asked to be removed from the position by the high court. till the time a division bench order restored suresh kumar in the role, the cmo saw a lull that proved how crucial the bureaucrat was to the functioning of the office. the episode, however, left the ‘palace intrigues’ against the officer an open secret.  the alleged role of a close political aide — who had stood by capt amarinder singh while akalis were in power for 10 years — and two senior bureaucrats in playing the games, of course, gave the opposition ammunition to attack the government. ultimately, the chief minister had to speak up for his man, and silence all talk, at least for now. the resignation of power minister rana gurjit singh over sand-mining taint was the other setback the government, and the chief minister personally, faced.  the clash of interests among the swarm of advisers around capt amarinder singh was quite plain as the cmo driven by bureaucracy put a check on their ambitions. there is a subtle resentment among the political advisers and osds. the situation has also led to the charge from within the party that due political representation is missing in the decision-making process. party leaders, after all, have come to power after 10 years!(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });  though not officially, political advisers have been told to stick to their brief of assisting the cm on issues other than the running of the government. they are thus now seen only when the chief minister visits the cmo to attend cabinet meetings. ‘restoring people’s confidence in govt’  punjab’s transformation and progress on all fronts, and the success of my government in restoring the confidence of the people, is our biggest achievement. and it is not just the ordinary citizens who are now feeling more secure, thanks to the marked improvement in law and order, but also the investors whose confidence has been revived. the elimination of gangsters and cracking of targeted-killing cases are significant accomplishments of the police.  on agriculture, too, successive smooth procurement seasons are a sign of things looking up. coupled with loan waiver and our thrust on diversification, there is a lot of positivity visible. transparency, resulting from the crackdown on various mafias, as well as e-governance initiatives, are notable successes. — capt amarinder singh, chief minister  finance white paper and red entries what’s done  a white paper on the economy, as promised, has been brought out. efforts are on to request the government of india to re-examine the settlement of legacy food credit bill of rs 31,000 crore that is eating away a major chunk of state finances. austerity in government/cost-cutting initiatives have been taken. most offices housed in rented accommodation have been shifted to government buildings. some departments have been merged to cut administrative costs.  what remains  the government is yet to get a grip on the state of finances. it has defaulted on paying salaries on time twice this year, in spite of 14 per cent increase in the state revenue since the gst rollout. the white paper revealed the “fiscal misdoings” of the previous akali-bjp government, but no action for future has been suggested in the document. the centre seems unwilling to relook at the settlement of food credit account, which is giving ulcers to the state’s financial managers. unpaid bills, carried forward from the last fiscal, halt to disbursal of social security pensions, and delay in paying out grants to match the centre’s contribution for several schemes have led to widespread resentment among people.  sarkarspeak we inherited the economy in a very bad state. but we have taken steps to rectify the faults created by our predecessors. we have been able to cut losses in the food account by rs 1,000 crore, from rs 1,800 crore we were spending each year. the state’s revenues have also increased by rs 1,100 crore. we ensured that the state finances did not avail the overdraft facility for very long, as was done during the previous government’s tenure. this helped us save several crores of rupees. — manpreet singh badal, finance minister  sand mining as clock ticks, reputation slips what’s done  capt amarinder singh government should be credited for using simple economics — increasing the supply of minor minerals (sand and gravel) to bring down the cost of these basic construction materials. even though the temptation of getting a finger in the sand-mining pie claimed the ministership of rana gurjit singh and threatens to unsettle charanjit singh channi too, the prices of sand and gravel have come down by almost rs 3,000-5,000 per 900 cubic ft (one tipper). certain corrections in the mining policy were later introduced to ensure greater transparency in the bidding process. changed from ‘reverse bidding’ to ‘progressive bidding’ for the auction of quarries, which helped the government increase its revenue from these auctions. capt amarinder singh, through repeated encouragement to officials to act against all, including his own partymen, has sought to send out the signal that he won’t come to the rescue of those hobnobbing with the sand mafia.  what remains  an intelligence report is learnt to have informed the chief minister that 32 congress mlas have stakes in sand mining. the biggest challenge before the government is to ensure that the ministers and all congress mlas stay away from the sand mining mafia. the public perception is strongly against the government. the names of at least 11 mlas, including a sitting minister and a senior elected functionary in the government, are being mentioned in this context openly.  the memory that it was public perception that hurt the previous government the most should be a cause of worry.  sarkarspeak the crackdown is already yielding results and will continue till the mafia is wiped out. there will be no compromise. for the first time in over a decade, this message has percolated down the rank and file. i have also told the civil officials and the police in categorical terms that they have to go after the big fish too and not confine action to small fry. we have to ensure that the revenue generated from the mining business finds its way to the state exchequer instead of going into the pockets of the corrupt. already, there is a marked increase in the revenue generation. for the period april 2017 to december 2018, the revenue from mining increased to rs 117 crore from rs 42 crore in fy 2016-17, and is expected to increase further by the end of the fiscal. — capt amarinder singh, who holds the charge of mining department  agriculture tale of drop in the ocean what’s done  small steps have been taken to ameliorate the suffering of indebted farmers through a crop-loan waiver scheme. after three years, the state managed to ensure smooth procurement of both wheat and paddy.  after several years, the state advised price (sap) for sugarcane was raised by rs 10 per quintal. action taken to ensure quality control on supply of pesticides, insecticides and seeds.  what remains  the crop-loan waiver scheme has drawn more flak than generate goodwill for the government. after several exclusions, only a small percentage of farmers will get a waiver of up to rs 2 lakh on crop loans. farmer suicides have continued unabated, with some estimates saying over 400 indebted farmers have ended their life since the congress government took over. no concrete action plan presented as yet for either ameliorating the economic condition of farmers or towards diversification of crops grown in the state.  sarkarspeak we have created the right environment which will pave the way for achieving our targets. apart from the process of farm loan waiver, which we have started in the right earnest as an urgent measure to alleviate the woes of the farmers, we are also looking at long-term initiatives for the revival of the farming sector. we are moving aggressively towards crop diversification, which, coupled with our initiatives to streamline irrigation facilities, will go a long way towards making our farmers self-reliant. we are incentivising farmers to go for crop diversification through various measures, including 80 per cent subsidy on drip irrigation as well as subsidy on the use of solar power for agriculture. we’ve also provided rs 3.19 crore from the rural development fund for cotton. — capt amarinder singh, who holds the charge of agriculture  education lessons in staffing what’s done  despite opposition from anganwari workers, the department has gone ahead with its programme of pre-primary education in 13,000 government schools. the aim was to tap children before they joined private schools. the department hopes to get services of at least 1,500 teachers under the cabinet-approved rationalisation policy, without any distinction between various categories of teacher. school principals will also take 12 classes/month (15 for headmasters). strong efforts to check mass copying during annual examinations. private schools have come under special scrutiny. special cadre of teachers created for border areas by offering them perks.  what remains  students suffering due to irregular supply of mid-day meals, textbooks, uniforms, etc, besides non-release of funds for post-matric scholarships. centre has released only rs 286.26 crore out of its due share of rs 683.46 crore till date under the sarva shiksha abhiyan (ssa). computerisation in primary schools remains a distant dream, besides missing classrooms and furniture. offer to pay only a fixed amount of rs 10,300 per month to teachers working at higher scales for the past several years as a condition for regularisation of service has generated a lot of bad blood.  sarkarspeak reforms don’t occur overnight, particularly when teacher organisations are holding ‘dharnas’ against our reforms. anomalies in 19 service rules were addressed recently. leaders complaining about shortage of teachers in villages are often the ones who come looking for easy transfers for kin. our changes are aimed at better education for our children. it will take some time, but the initial results will start showing soon. — aruna chaudhary, education minister  environment solutions, all on paper what’s done  $1 million “paddy straw management challenge fund” announced for whoever finds a solution to the problem. increased monitoring of straw burning through satellites and field functionaries, plus awareness campaign. govt employees and panchayats ordered not to burn paddy straw in their fields. deal with chennai-based firm to set up 400 plants to convert crop residue into bio-energy. each plant to have capacity to process 50,000 tonnes/year. government re-notifies over 21,000 acres of eco-fragile land around chandigarh under the punjab land preservation act (plpa) 1900. this includes 3,725 acre of siswan village, where capt amarinder singh has bought land. fencing of forest areas begins; 1,000-acre forestland freed from encroachments. hunting permits eased wood-based industrial park proposed. a rs 650-cr project, fully funded by the centre, approved for providing machinery like happy seeder and bailing rigs to farmers for paddy straw management. funds will be available in 2018-19.  what remains  state’s demand for a bonus of rs 100 per quintal of paddy for farmers who do not burn straw not met yet. only 85 of 165 cities in punjab have sewage treatment plants (stps). though constructed under the previous government, only a handful are working. untreated sewage flows into drains and rivers. of 50 towns identified for discharging effluents into the beas, sutlej and ghaggar rivers, only 28 have set up stps. monitoring is woefully inadequate. nothing substantial done on policy to increase forest cover. though some action has been taken against illicit felling, forest mafia is yet to catch necessary attention of the government.  sarkarspeak the government is going all out to check water, air and noise pollution, especially the issue of burning paddy straw. we undertook a mammoth exercise of regular monitoring of incidents of fire in the fields. — ks pannu, chairman, punjab pollution control board  health on pills and prayers what’s done  punjab became first state to launch 240 ‘health and wellness centres’. part of plan for 2,950 such centres. launched a mobile food-testing lab to check adulterated food. also started online inspection and sampling system to expedite testing. to eliminate tb by 2025, punjab launched a free x-ray service to diagnose patients in all government hospitals. biometric attendance for staff in all government hospitals.  what remains  work not started on promise of developing all primary health centres and community health centres as independent multi-specialty hospitals. in its manifesto, the congress promised five new medical colleges. however, even the foundation stone of medical college approved for mohali by the previous government has not been laid. three existing government medical colleges remain in pathetic condition. no district hospital could get diagnostic equipment such as mri, ct-scan. the clinical establishment act, which aims to regulate the functioning of private hospitals, yet to be implemented. draft gathering dust for five years.  sarkarspeak in 10 years of sad-bjp rule, they purchased the equipment, but didn’t think of hiring people to operate them; they built buildings for hospitals and de-addiction centres, but didn’t hire human resource for them. after one year, i am still trying to clear the mess i have inherited. — brahm mohindra, health minister  drugs over the high, far from clean what’s done  in the very first cabinet meeting on march 18 last year, a special task force (stf) was constituted to “wipe out” the scourge of drugs from the state within four weeks. over the past year, the punjab police arrested 13,880 persons in 12,546 cases registered under the ndps act. similarly, 1,473 persons were arrested by the stf in 939 cases registered under the ndps act. some initial arrests by stf exposed the nexus between police and drug dealers; it also led to the arrest of a few policemen. availability of drugs on ground has reduced, but completely wiping out drugs may be a goal too far. to cover every village, the government introduced 26 ‘outpatient opioid assisted treatment’ centres in three districts — amritsar, tarn taran and moga. at these centres, around 3,000 patients have been treated.  what remains  the stf too seems to be succumbing to the internal politics of police, as it has become a parallel power centre. fast-track district courts were promised to decide ndps cases within 30 days. nothing has happened. a promised review of around 45,000 cases registered mainly against drug users over the past decade has not been done. the sad-bjp government spent around rs 100 crore on building drug de-addiction centres, but this government has done precious little to get addicts to these centres. on the other hand, private centres are overflowing. as per a recent pan-punjab study by the pgi, there are over 3 lakh people who were dependent on banned drugs in the state. allegations of drugs making their way into jails keep haunting the government.  sarkarspeak the stf is coordinating implementation of the edp (enforcement-deaddiction-prevention) model. district police and the stf have registered cases against 12,780 offenders under the ndps act between march 16, 2017, and february 28, 2018. steps are also being taken to attach and confiscate the properties of drug smugglers. a proposal for preventive detention under the prevention of illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances act is at an advanced stage with the government.  the outpatient opioid assisted treatment (ooat) model to provide services to addicts to reduce consumption is being implemented by the health department. prevention aspect is being approached with a long-term perspective by focusing on students. alongside, the drug abuse prevention officer (dapo) programme — to be launched later this month — focuses at the community level in localities. the aim is to ensure maximum results at the minimal cost to the state. — harpreet sidhu, head, special task force  industry struggling, block by block what’s done  the government unveiled a new industrial policy in november 2017, wherein “thrust” sectors like high-tech manufacturing, technical textiles, and food processing were exempted from state gst. the congress had promised the policy would come within 90 days of assuming office, but it took seven months. a rs 100-crore fund was created to promote a “start-up culture” to provide entrepreneurs with “world class” facilities. mou signed for setting up a start-up in the stpi’s incubation centre in mohali, where the state has proposed to set up india’s largest govt-supported “startup hub”.  one-time settlement policy introduced for the loanees of the punjab state industrial development corporation. electricity tariff for the existing and new industry was fixed at rs 5 per unit (excluding other charges) from january 1, 2018.  what remains  the government launched the industrial policy in november 2017, but it is yet to introduce the operational guidelines for the policy. attracting actual big-ticket investment remains a challenge, even as the cm has signed mous with various industry houses. start-ups in the state are yet to get funding, as announced by the chief minister under the start-up policy. lower power tariff has been provided only to industry, keeping out the services sector (it/ites/bpo). even for industry the cost becomes rs 6.5 to rs 6.7 per unit after levy of charges and duties, not rs 5 as promised. plug-in system for start-ups is yet to see the light of day. freight equalisation incentives yet to be introduced. it is required as punjab is very far from the major ports from where raw material comes, which makes it uncompetitive. finished goods also have to be sent out over great distances.  sarkarspeak on being asked by an it industry representative about the electricity tariff parity for them with the manufacturing sector, capt amarinder singh promised to examine the matter. he was addressing industry members at tiecon 2018. the operational guidelines of the industry policy-2017 are just a provisional formality, and will be placed before the next cabinet meeting for approval. — dps kharbanda, director, industry & commerce  transport old driver, new wheels what’s done  controversial and allegedly pro-akali state transport commissioner harmel singh, whose writ ran unquestioned for years, removed. the new transport policy promised in the manifesto was notified just a few days before the completion of one year of the government.  what remains  no end to a flood of litigation on the route permits, bus time-table issues, extension of route permits, favouritism to a few transporters. incumbent stc gave directions based on high court orders regarding the transport business, but went beyond the court directions, resulting in fresh litigation and stay on new initiatives. even the new transport policy is awaiting court clearance. monopoly of the badal family on the bus transport sector has not only continued but gained strength. they are buying more buses and route permits. share of the government buses — of prtc and punjab roadways — has gone down in new transport policy — from 75 to 50 per cent on national-highway routes and 60 to 40 per cent on state highways/district roads. bus time-tables made by previous govt to allegedly favour badal family buses remain unchanged.  service to people remains poor. there is no control on speeding or illegal halts. public-sector transport has failed to increase luxury ac buses. bus terminals continue to be unclean.  sarkarspeak the transport sector has been overhauled by the government, with a crackdown on the mafia. as a result, there has been a 23% jump in the department’s earnings. prtc, punjab roadways and punbus revenues have also increased substantially. new policy will not allow more than 25% permits to one transporter on any route. this will open up new avenues for youth. orders have also been placed for 500 new ordinary and 40 luxury buses. — capt amarinder singh, handles transport dept  policing all is well, till it goes wrong what’s done  police busted a gang of alleged khalistan sympathisers suspected to have carried out targeted killings in recent years. notorious gangsters arrested, with the top one, vicky gounder, and his aides gunned down in an encounter. almost all fugitives and conspirators in the nabha jailbreak case arrested. crucial conspirator romi arrested in hong kong; his extradition is under way. no major sacrilege case reported in past year. no dera sacha sauda-related violence during tension over arrest of the dera chief. police officials claim there has been minimal political interference in postings and investigation.  what remains  department is stable, but new groups have emerged who aim for control over the dgp post and proximity to the cm. promised recruitment at lower ranks has not been started. promised weekly off to personnel not implemented, barring in ludhiana. no major impetus for modernisation of the force. snatchings continue unabated with no special drive against the crime, affecting common citizens. allegations of akali leaders continuing to wield influence over police in certain areas. inquiries brushed under the carpet due to political interference, especially in drug- related cases.  sarkarspeak the improvement in law and order is manifest in the growing sense of security among people. with significant decline in heinous crimes, elimination of dreaded gangsters, and solving of targeted killings, there has been restoration of public confidence. — capt amarinder singh, incharge, home  cityscape huge pile to clear what’s done  forensic audit currently under way by global consultant grant thorton of the infrastructure works carried

out of total 165, have been declared odf (open defecation free) till february 28. provision made for reserving at least 50 per cent seats for women in local bodies. bus rapid transit system in

space to park or staff to operate them. ludhiana rdf (refuse-derived fuel) plant has become functional; by april 30, the waste to energy plant at nakodar is expected. however, after poor results of waste management in amritsar, pathankot, patiala, jalandhar and bathinda, the government is attempting decentralisatioin with pilot projects at nawanshahr, moonak, bhadson and cheema.  sarkarspeak

nandan nilekani will allow us to provide 67 services online. getting building plans online will a big change. we have already received rs 700 crore for setting up a directorate of fire services. work is being carried out with a vision for the future, not just immediate requirements. — navjot singh sidhu, minister for local government  social welfare words of comfort what’s done  on july 1, 2017, the government increased social security pension for over 16 lakh beneficiaries (old-age, widows, dependent children, differently abled) from rs 500 to rs 750/month. amount under aashirwad scheme

scheduled castes was increased from 15% to 30% in all schemes pertaining to allotment of plots/houses.  what remains  despite increase in social security pension to rs 750, it remains much lower than neighbouring haryana, which gives rs 1,800. the poll promise was rs 1,500. reservation in government jobs for obcs yet to be increased from 12% to 15%. promise of raising amount under aashirwad scheme to rs 51,000 has not even reached the halfway mark. job in every sc and obc household still awaited. reservation not made for scs in contractual jobs and for various posts in trusts, boards and corporations  sarkarspeak when i took over the welfare department, it was lying defunct and was a den of corruption. we have not only acted against corrupt officials but also tried to develop a

needless to say, that was the end of it, he added.  haryana implemented the scheme and its farmers have alleged that the insurance companies collected over rs 750 crore in premium, but only disbursed rs 112 crore as compensation. the matter was even raised in parliament, rajewal claims. keep arhtiya out  buta singh burj gill, president of the bku (dakaunda), too minces no words in denouncing the scheme in its present form as anti-farmer and pro-corporate. we desperately need insurance but not at these costs and terms, he added.  there are no takers for even premiums heavily subsidised by the centre and the states (in equal proportion). farmers pay 2 per cent of the premium for kharif crops, 1.5 per cent for rabi and 5 per cent for horticulture crops. on an average, a farmer has to pay rs 800 per acre for rabi and kharif crops and rs 1,250 per acre for cotton as premium. they are not able to bear that cost.  the need is to scrap the arhtiya system. the money/profits collected by this system under the present procurement arrangement can be used to pay the pmfby premium, saving both farmers and the government this recurring fiscal burden once and for all, gill suggests.  the mandi board is equipped to buy the produce from the farmers, and everyone would be more than willing to clean the crop, weigh it and transport it to the nearest state godown. this would not only provide employment to the landless labourers, but also mean an additional income for the farmers on freight charges, he pointed out. as it is, farmers transport the produce to the mandis.  when the government knows that the farmers are fiscally distressed and committing suicides, why burden them with another life-long liability, asks gill. unresponsive state govts  punjab’s reluctance to implement the pmfby also drew the attention of union agriculture minister radha mohan singh, who told the rajya sabha recently that the state should seriously consider implementing the scheme as it had neither sent a draft for drought relief nor done crop insurance in the past five years.  “i have seen the record of the state; punjab’s farmers do not go in for crop insurance. but during drought, even a request for relief was not made to us,” he added.  under the pmfby, there would be no upper limit on the subsidy provided by the centre or the state. “even if the balance premium (after farmers’ contribution) is 90 per cent, it will be borne by the government,” according to an official.  in previous schemes, the premium had been capped, which resulted in low claims being paid to farmers. this was done to limit the government outgo on the premium subsidy. “this has been removed. farmers will get the claim against the full sum insured without any deductions,” the official says.  another benefit of the pmfby is that losses incurred from the sowing stage to the post-harvest season would all be covered. earlier, only post-harvest losses could be offset. farmers who haven’t availed bank loans would also be eligible for insurance cover. solution in guaranteed income; production, market risk both covered  while farmer unions have been agitating for implementing the ms swaminathan commission recommendations and bureaucrats are clueless on what to do, a report by punjab agricultural university (pau), ludhiana, in 2014 suggested that a study of all insurance schemes since 1974 till date had revealed that opting for the farm income insurance scheme (fiis-2003-04) would be the best bet for punjab.  as this is the sole scheme covering both production and market risk, it could also be used for giving a boost to the flagging diversification drive of the state, the pau study observed.  it envisages targeting two critical components that decides a farmer’s income — yield and price — through a single policy instrument by ensuring a “minimum guaranteed income” determined by using the average yield for the previous seven years and the msp. if the actual income falls short of the guaranteed sum, the farmer would be eligible for compensation to the extent of indemnity from the agricultural insurance company (aic) of india."

298,2015-03-18,https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-budget-speech-text/55244.html,"punjab budget speech text. the complete text of punjab finance minister parminder singh dhindsa's budget speech, presented in the state assembly on wednesday:  (there may be certain discrepancies in the formatting of the matter as reproduced from the text supplied by the punjab government) part a hon’ble speaker sir, it is my privilege to present before this august house, the fourth consecutive budget of the re-elected shiromani akali dal and bhartiya janta party alliance government for the year 2015-16. 2.    the world is upbeat about india as her economy has entered a promising era with a series of economic reforms ushered in by the nda government at the centre. as per the imf and the world bank’s latest forecasts, india is set to soon become the fastest growing big economy in the world. these times present a unique opportunity to the state of punjab to uplift its own economy by becoming a key partner in the national economic growth process. i strongly believe that the shiromani akali dal and bhartiya janta party government led by our most respected leader sardar parkash singh badal ji and dynamic leader sardar sukhbir singh badal ji with support of the reform minded nda government at the centre will herald a new dawn for punjab’s economy.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); 3.    the budget has been prepared against a changed backdrop created by increased devolutions from the 14th finance commission and a concomitant reduction in plan transfers to states in the union budget. the steps and policies outlined in the budget for 2015-16 presented by me reflect the commitment of our government to put the state economy on the path of sustained high economic growth the benefits of which will reach all sections of the society.  the budget also lays down steps to steer the state towards the 2 course of prudent fiscal consolidation, promote industrial development, revive the agriculture sector and promote all round inclusive development. while we chart the course forpunjab’s economic progress we are mindful of the diverse challenges facing the state like drug abuse, adverse child sex ratio, rising incidence of cancer, fiscal stress and youth unemployment. the government is making its best efforts to address these challenges and with adequate support from the centre we will certainly overcome these in a short span of time. 4.    i had made certain commitments while presenting the budgets for 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15. our government has implemented a majority of them while action has been initiated on others. i will dwell upon them while discussing the budget proposals of the individual departments. mr. speaker sir, i will now discuss the economic and fiscal parameters of the state in some detail. economic growth 5.    as per advance estimates, the gsdp at current prices is estimated to grow at 10.16% in the current fiscal year (2014-15).  during the year 2013-14, the gsdp at constant prices grew at 5.73% against the national growth rate of 4.74%. the per capita income of the state at current prices is also estimated to increase from rs 92350 in 2013-14 to rs 99578 in 2014-15 (a). fiscal consolidation 6.    to promote growth by judicious use of scarce resources and 3 to achieve intergenerational equity, fiscal discipline is of utmost importance. the government is taking all steps to ensure that it ‘lives within the means‘ and thereby stabilises its debt and deficit position. before i present the fiscal indicators i am glad to inform the house that the 14th finance commission (fc) in its recommendations has increased the share of punjab in central taxes from 1.389% to 1.577%. i am also happy to share with the august house that the 14th finance commission has also recognised the fiscal turnaround of the state due to efforts made by our government and has therefore removed it from the list of states needing revenue deficit grant. 7.    now i turn to the success made by the state in achieving fiscal consolidation. punjab is well within limits of most of the fiscal targets set by the 13th finance commission and under the frbm act. the fiscal deficit came down from 3.45% of gsdp in 2006-07 to 2.77% of gsdp in 2013-14 and is estimated at 2.97% of gsdp in 2014-15 (re) well within the 13th fc target of 3.0%. for the year 2015-16 (be), the fiscal deficit of state government is projected at 2.98% of gsdp. 8.    the diligent efforts of the state government have enabled it to keep the debt within manageable limits as is reflected in the rapid decline in debt to gsdp ratio. in 2014-15, the outstanding debt to gsdp ratio is pegged at 32.27% (re), well ahead of the target of 38.7% set by 13th fc for the year 2014-15. during 2015-16, the outstanding debt to gsdp ratio of the state is projected to be 31.34% of gsdp. 9.    reduction in revenue deficit remains a challenge for the state government in the wake of the implementation of the 5th punjab pay commission recommendations which saw a significant increase in its committed expenditure on salaries and pensions. as i will present in the later part of the speech, due to sustained efforts of the government the own tax revenue to gsdp ratio as also the non tax revenues have increased in the recent years, however declining share of punjab in central taxes had constrained the overall resource position of the state. this situation though is set to take a better turn now with the latest 14th finance commission recommendations which has resulted in increased devolution albeit at the cost of reduced plan allocation. 10.  realising the importance of own tax revenue in meeting our expenditure needs, the state made sustained efforts to raise its own tax revenue. consequently, between 2007-08 and 2014-15 (re) the state’s own tax revenue increased at an average annual growth rate of 16%. 11.  the quality of expenditure incurred by the government has also improved in the recent years as reflected in the increasing ratio of development expenditure to total expenditure of the state government. during 2013-14, the percentage of developmental expenditure to the total expenditure of the state was 52.24% which substantially improved to 55.39 %in 2014-15(re). for the year 2015-16 (be) the ratio of developmental expenditure to total expenditure of the state is budgeted to go up to 55.60%. in addition the capital expenditure of the state government has witnessed a significant rise of 79% from rs 2200.61 crore in 2013-14 to rs 3948.28 crore in 2014-15 (re). 12.  before i enter into details of sector-wise budgetary provisions, i would like to summarise at the outset some major new initiatives our government has proposed for the year 2015-16. the guiding philosophy of ‘sarbat da bhala’ has led us to design these schemes for inclusive development of all the sections of our society. good governance 13.  sir, i take pride in stating that the assiduous efforts of our government have made punjab a leading state in the implementation of e-governance initiatives. one such landmark initiative in citizen centric service delivery is the setting up of sewa kendras. fulfilling our commitment to bring the ‘government at the doorstep’ we are establishing unified service centers (sewa kendras) in rural and urban areas. 2174 sewa kendras will be set up within this year for providing 50 services to the citizens at their doorsteps. within the next two years, over 200 services will be covered through sewa kendras. rs 500 crore have been earmarked for this purpose. agriculture 14.  agriculture is the mainstay of punjab’s economy, providing livelihood to over 60% of the population in the state. the government is committed to the growth of this sector with a special emphasis on sustainable agriculture and improvement in the incomes of the farmers. i welcome the union government’s budget announcement of setting up post graduate institute of horticulture research and education in amritsar. punjab is set to become a leading state in horticulture research and i sincerely hope that the crop diversification process in the state will scale new heights with the establishment of this institute. 15.  cooperatives have been playing a crucial role in the development of agriculture and allied sector of punjab. the sugar cooperatives have successfully contributed to crop diversification in the state by increasing the area under sugarcane. the current falling prices of sugar have caused financial difficulties to the cooperatives, making it difficult for them to pay the farmers on time. i have therefore allocated rs 600 crore for support to sugar cooperatives for making timely payments to cane growers. i have also made an allocation of rs 80 crore for recapitalisation of central cooperative banks in order to further strengthen them to increase their lending for agriculture. industry 16.  sir, the micro and small enterprises have made a significant contribution to the overall development of the manufacturing sector in the state. punjab has a significant presence of micro and small enterprises which are potential ‘engines of growth and inclusive development’. these units deserve all encouragement given the huge employment potential they offer. to alleviate the financing difficulties faced by micro and small entrepreneurs, i propose to launch an ‘entrepreneurship development programme’ for a period of five years. under this programme an interest subvention at the rate of 3% will be provided on loan taken to set up a micro or small enterprise with investment of up to rs 5 crore. for the year 2015-16 an allocation of rs 100 crore has been provided for the scheme. 17.  the recent economic downturn also affected our industry adversely and many borrowers from psidc, pfc and paic are facing genuine difficulty in repaying their loans. with a view to bringing the blocked industrial investment into productive use and to revive the existing punjab industry, government is bringing a reasonable ots policy for promoted and loanee companies of psidc, pfc and paic. under this policy, besides hundreds of those small scale industrial units, financed by pfc, settling their accounts and getting revived, another 60 large and medium scale industrial projects, besides around 15 industrial projects of paic are likely to get revived and pfc, psidc and paic are expected to effect recovery of significant public monies. youth skilling punjab youth 18.  the future of punjab lies with the youth which make up almost 30% of the total population of the state. to enhance the employability of youth, our government is committed to empower them with the right skills in tune with the industry requirements.  keeping this in view and also the fact that with a significant presence 8 of msme sector, the state will be a crucial partner in the ‘make in india’ campaign, the state has set up an empowered ‘state skill development mission’ with three tiers at state, district and block level. 19.  under this mission 22 multi skill development centres, one in each district is proposed to be set up in a phased manner. in the first phase, centres are being set up at ludhiana, amritsar, bathinda, hoshiarpur, jalandhar and ropar to meet short term skill development needs of the state. the mission is also in the process of setting up three skill development centres in the health sector at medical colleges, amritsar, patiala and faridkot. 20.  under this mission, i also propose to set up three specialised skill development centres in construction sector in partnership with renowned companies in the construction sector. to provide skill training at their doorsteps, 2000 skill training centres for girls and 500 centres for boys will be opened in villages in the existing infrastructure of government schools and other buildings at village level when they are not in use. the state government proposes to spend rs 200 crore on these initiatives. higher education funding 21.  sir, to ensure that just for want of funds not a single dream of pursuing higher education of poor students remains unfulfilled, i am glad to propose education funding for students belonging to blue card holder families securing admission to the institutes of national importance. sports 22.  sir, the contribution of punjabis to the world of sports is widely recognised. it is a matter of great pride that a large number of punjabis have represented the country in a number of international sports events. to further improve upon the capabilities of punjabis, to tap the talent at the right time, to train and to create sportspersons of international level and to groom them as medal prospects, our government has established punjab institute of sports (pis). under pis there will be centres of excellence for 12 identified games. around 6000 sports persons from 14 years of age and onwards will be identified from all over the state and will be trained in these centres of excellence created in different parts of the state. the admitted players would be provided free boarding and lodging at the centres, arrangements will be made for their proper education and scientific training under expert indian & foreign coaches. pis will have a budget of rs. 50 crore annually. 23.  to strengthen the sports infrastructure stadiums, multipurpose stadiums at all district headquaters have been built or upgraded or are being built at a cost of rs. 320 crore. in this endeavour a multipurpose stadium at pathankot and fatehgarh sahib is being built and the stadium at barnala is being upgraded.  at the block level, i propose setting up of one block level stadium in each block of the state in the next five years. a hockey stadium will also be constructed at ferozepur with a cost of rs. 10.31 crore. urban development 24.  urban population constitutes 37% of the total population of the state. our government is successfully meeting the challenges of urbanisation through various initiatives. sir, i put forth yet another proposal to fulfil the dream of providing “affordable housing for all”, that 50,000 houses for ews will be constructed in next two years in collaboration with hudco and will be allotted to the beneficiaries under the scheme on emi payable in 20 years. 25.  i also reiterate the commitment of our government to provide 100% sewerage and water supply coverage in all municipal and corporation towns. i am glad to announce the launch of the ‘punjab urban development mission’ under which 100% water supply, sewerage, stp, road & streetlights will be provided in all the cities by the year 2017. rural development 26.  despite the accelerated growth of urbanisation, there is no denying the fact that punjab resides in its villages. “pinda ch vasda punjab”. development of villages is the top priority of our government and to take it further i propose to launch the ‘mukh mantri pendu vikas yojana’. the scheme envisages comprehensive development of villages through provision of basic amenities. for the current fiscal, a sum of rs 600 crore has been earmarked for this scheme. water supply & sanitation 27.  i am pleased to share with the house that the world bank 11 has approved the 2nd punjab rural water supply and sanitation project spread over six years (2015-16 to 2020-21) with a total cost of rs 2200 crore. the objective of the project is to improve rural water supply and sanitation services and service delivery arrangements in the state. the convergence of the project with swachh bharat mission (gramin) would ensure individual toilets for every household in the state by 2018. health 28.  sir, i appreciate the union government’s decision to set up an aiims in punjab which will further strengthen the healthcare infrastructure in the state. the state government is setting up medicity near mullanpur in mohali, which will house many of the best known names in healthcare. i also propose to support the medical health insurance scheme, the “bhagat puran singh sehat bima yojana”, which will provide cashless medical treatment through smart cards to 30 lakh blue card holder families in addition to 4.50 lakh bpl families. this scheme will provide protection to around 1.50 crore population of economically weaker households from financial liabilities arising out of health shocks that involve hospitalization. hospitalization expenses up to rs 30,000/- will be met by the government in empanelled government and private hospitals. an initial provision of rs 50 crore has been kept in the annual budget 2015-16. women 29.  it is rightly said that “you educate a woman and you educate 12 a generation”. education is the cornerstone of women empowerment.  even to this day many of our girl students especially in rural areas miss school for lack of basic facilities like girls toilets. sir, to ensure that no girl student misses education due to lack of basic facilities in schools, i propose a scheme of ‘strengthening of girls schools’ in punjab. under the scheme, 121 government girls high schools/senior secondary schools in 144 cd blocks will be strengthened in terms of basic infrastructure. i propose to allocate rs 20 crore under this scheme for 2015-16. sc welfare 30.  welfare of scheduled castes is an integral part of our strategy of inclusive growth. for integrated development of all the villages having sc population of more than 50%, i propose a sum of rs 45 crore in the year 2015-16 under the pradhan mantri adarsh gram yojana. minority welfare 31.  our government is sensitive to the interests of the minorities in the state. we are committed to their welfare and protection of their interests. sir, for the year 2015-16, i propose to earmark a sum of rs 10 crore each for setting up of muslim and christian burial grounds in the state. green punjab 32.  sir, recently the parliament cleared the motor vehicles (amendment) bill, recognising battery-powered e-rickshaws as a 13 valid form of commercial transport. the state government has decided to introduce e rickshaws in the old corporation towns in the first phase with the twin objectives of providing employment opportunities to the poor and curb air pollution in the cities. the government will soon launch a scheme to offer attractive loans to people to buy e-rickshaws. tourism & culture 33.  sir, our government is deeply committed to properly project and protect the rich cultural heritage of the state, and realize its full potential in tourism sector. in fulfilment of the vision of our honourable chief minister, the government is setting up memorials in the memory of important events and personalities. a state of the art memorial jang-e-azadi in the memory of people of punjab who participated in the freedom struggle is being set up at kartarpur. war memorial cum museum is coming up at amritsar.  guru ravidass memorial is being set up at khuralgarh, in district hoshiarpur, bhai mardana ji memorial at ferozepur and baba moti ram mehra ji memorial at fatehgarh sahib. bhagwan balmiki tirath sthal (ram tirath) at amritsar is also being redeveloped. over rs 500 crore have been earmarked for these initiatives. 34.  sir, i am pleased to announce that a sum of rs 500 crore has been provided for carrying out various tourism and culture related works in the holy city of amritsar. some of the major works proposed to be undertaken are construction of entrance plaza in the forecourt of shri harmandir sahib, facade improvement of surroundings of golden temple, jallianwala bagh, town hall and hall gate in amritsar. others 35.  sir, it has been decided to establish a gaushala in every district to take care of stray cattle. to this effect a ‘district animal welfare society’ under the chairmanship of the deputy commissioner will be established in every district which will set up the infrastructure for gaushalas. this initiative will go a long way in protecting the farmers from the damage to crops caused by stray cattle and in preventing fatal accidents caused by them. 36.  to curb the threats posed by stray dogs, i also propose to set up dog pounds in every district to take care of stray dogs. the dog pounds will provide care and shelter to the homeless stray dogs. part b sir, now i would like to present the budget proposals in greater detail plan size & performance 37.  there has been significant improvement in size of approved annual plan of the state and its implementation since 2006-07.  the approved annual plan during 2006-07 was rs 4,000 crore, which increased to rs 20,100 crore in 2014-15. the implementation of annual plan was 65% during 2011-12, 72% during 2012-13 and 73% during 2013-14. the likely financial achievement in 2014-15 is 80%.  the size of the plan is rs 21,174 crore for the year 2015-16 with an increase of 5% over the previous year’s plan. the increase in the size of annual plan 2015-16 is modest in view of the expected reduction in central assistance. 38.  the union government has further restructured the 66 centrally sponsored schemes in to 3 categories i.e. (i) schemes to be fully supported by union government, (ii) schemes delinked from support of the centre and (iii)schemes to be run with the changed sharing pattern. the details are awaited from government of india. agriculture crop husbandry 39.  punjab has been contributing about 50-60% of wheat and about 35-40% of rice procured by the government of india for food security of the country for the last four decades. i congratulate the farmers for the record production of wheat in the current rabi season. during rabi 2013-14, the production of wheat was 176.20 lakh tonnes out of which 119 lakh tonnes has been procured by the state. in kharif 2014 the production of paddy was 169.62 lakh tonnes against which 121 lakh tonnes has been procured. the free power supplied to the farmers at a cost of about rs 4,778 crore has proved vital in this regard. the state government invested rs 38765 crore for procurement of wheat and paddy in the state in the year 2014-15. compensation for loss due to natural calamity has been enhanced from rs 2000 to rs 5000 per acre. 40.  the crop diversification process in the state is going on successfully. four maize drying units have been installed and three more units are being set up. a project has been started to mechanize the cotton production system from sowing till picking. every year, additional area of approximately 4000 hectare is brought under fruits by supplying healthy, disease free plants. horticulture development board is being setup in the state to promote development of citrus, guava, litchi & pear fruits. hi-tech vegetable seedlings nurseries are proposed for patiala, attari (amritsar) and bir charik (moga). it is proposed to set-up a multi product mega food park in 200 acres of land at ladhowal. a centre of excellence for vegetable cultivation in collaboration with government of israel has been set up on 15 acres of land at kartarpur, jalandhar and a centre of excellence for potato is being set up at dhogri (jalandhar) 17 under indo-dutch agreement. it is proposed to modernize existing cold stores which have bunker system in next 3 years. 41.  our government is committed to strengthen the agriculture and allied sectors in the state and i propose to allocate rs 3512 crores for the agriculture sector. some of the main scheme wise allocations for the annual plan 2015-16 are: ·         rs 600 crore – for making payment to cane growers. ·         rs 300 crore - for punjab agricultural university, ludhiana. ·         rs 230 crore – for strengthening of agriculture and allied sectors under rkvy. ·         rs 63.50 crore – for national horticulture mission. ·         rs 50 crore – for national food security mission. soil & water conservation 42.  government is alive to the need for soil & water conservation in the state. a number of initiatives have been taken to address this issue like banning the early plantation of paddy, providing machines like happy seeders, rotavators, zero-till-drills, laser land levellers, balers and rakes to farmers on subsidy. i propose an allocation of rs 181 crores for judicious use of available water & soil conservation measures. allied sectors 43.  allied sector is a focus area of the government due to its huge employment generation potential especially in rural areas. to boost the livestock sector, advisory boards have been set up for dairy, piggery, goatry and fisheries. subsidy would be provided for setting up automatic milk dispensing units. five dairy service centres for renting out costly machinery would be established. for breed improvement, cattle breeding farm at rauni, district patiala is being established and semen bank nabha is being upgraded. a new veterinary college is proposed to be established at rampuraphul in district bathinda. mou is being signed with china for promotion of fisheries sector. a regional research centre for fisheries would be established at village jodhpur rumana, district bathinda. modern hygienic wholesale fish markets would be set up at district bathinda and amritsar. power tariff has been reduced from rs 7.75 per unit to rs 4.57 per unit for the allied farming sector. 44.  i have proposed an allocation of rs 451 crore for animal husbandry sector for the year 2015-16. out of this 20 crore has been allocated for gadvasu. farm debts 45.  farmer indebtedness is a grave challenge facing the state. rs 94 crore have been distributed during 2012-14 covering 4688 families affected by farmers’ suicides from 2000-2011. to take care of the farmers’ families, i have provided rs 20 crore for compensation to the families of the farmers who have committed suicide. food & civil supplies 46.  our government launched the atta dal scheme in order to 19 ensure that prices of essential commodities remain within the reach of the common man. in the annual plan 2015-16, rs 400 crore has been allocated for new atta dal scheme and it is estimated that 8,70,000 mts of wheat and 65,000 mts of pulses shall be distributed during the year. rural development 47.  sir, the national rural employment guarantee scheme has proved instrumental in enhancing the livelihood security of rural households. i propose an initial allocation of rs 233 crore under this scheme for the financial year 2015-16. 48.  the total provision for rural development is pegged at rs 1710 crore which includes rs 600 crore for mukh mantri pendu vikas yojana. water supply & sanitation 49.  sir, to provide safe drinking water to our citizens, 1824 ro systems have been set up in rural areas of the state and another 561 ros will be set up during 2015-16. i propose the following plan allocations under various schemes of this sector: ·         rs 150 crore - for 2nd punjab rural water supply and sanitation sector improvement programme – world bank assisted project. ·         rs 100 crore-for installation of ro systems to provide

which, the works amounting to rs 3866 crore are already under implementation. the state government will also work actively to derive maximum advantage under the newly announced schemes of the union budget 2015-16 – mission for development of 100 smart cities, urban rejuvenation mission – 500 habitations and sardar patel urban housing scheme. 51.  other major housing initiatives during 2015-16 include: ·         ecocity – phase-ii to be developed in an area of 310 acres. ·         medicity phase-ii-160 acres of land acquired, of which 10 acres of land allotted to the max healthcare

obviously, it’s the illegally mined minerals that are catering to the demand,” says ropar-based rti activist darshan singh grewal. he says the one way to this is to bring sand under the gst net.  umpteen reports of how boat-like platforms that support the rig that pumps out water from illegally created mines, and have disturbed the topography of villages near faridkot, have appeared. till a few years ago, faridkot was not known for having adequate minor minerals for extraction. similarly, there have been reports of 40-ft-deep pits being dug on the banks of the sutlej to extract the sand near garhshankar.  capt amarinder singh, while flying towards jalandhar in 2018, had himself expressed shock at the extent of mining he could see in nawanshahr and ropar. at other places, even the power transmission system has been threatened because of illegal mining around the poles.  birinder singh dhillon, ropar district president of the punjab pradesh congress committee, told the tribune that in spite of best efforts of the congress government to control the menace, it had failed to yield results. “this is because of the strong nexus between mining department officials, contractors and some politicians. it is because of unauthorised and illegal mining that several areas in ropar were flooded after a heavy downpour and discharge of water in the sutlej last month. i have set up a committee of party workers to expose this nexus, and bring it to the notice of the chief minister,” he said.  though the common man is so far not affected by the high prices, the day is not far when the politician-mining contractor-official nexus could become an achilles heel for the government. ________________________________________________ where is the supply coming from?  legal mining is taking place at only 16 quarries of nearly 100 that have been auctioned by the state government in the last 2 years.  of 52 quarries that were auctioned in may 2017, contractors could not deposit quarterly instalments and withdrew from the contracts on 36 quarries.  the demand for sand remains the same and legal quarries are closed. but there is no shortage of material nor have the prices of sand and gravel gone up.   therefore, it is clear that illegally extracted sand and mining minerals are catering to the demand."

contaminated water, erratic power supply and lack of sewerage continue to be the bane of border area residents.  dala village, 10 km from the wire fencing in gurdaspur district, is symptomatic of villages near the zero line. notwithstanding tall claims by the punjab state power corporation limited (pspcl), supply is erratic that has a cascading effect on basic utilities such as drinking water.  villagers spend huge sums on sinking deep bore tubewells and install diesel-operated pumpsets just to get drinking water. “one has to sink a bore well at 300 ft. and even at this depth, we get uncontaminated water. this means an expense in excess of rs1 lakh,” a villager says.  “people in this belt own small landholdings. they get a bore well dug for rs20,000 to rs30,000 at 60 to 70 ft and then install an ro system,” says harpreet dala.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });  the pspcl claims it supplies uninterrupted power. the connections of waterworks are snapped when panchayats default on their bills, it says.  recently, strong winds uprooted or broke poles. the staff struggled to get things back on track for 48 hours. villagers have a solution: they want the pspcl to lay underground cables. officials, however, claim they do not have the money to do so.  also, pipes from water tank to homes remain broken. officials find it tedious to repair them in border areas.  “the punjab rural water supply and sanitation project (phase-1), financed by the 16th world bank mission during the badal’s rule spent money on improving the water supply mechanism in border villages, but the purpose was defeated by erratic power supply. unless uninterrupted electricity is given to waterworks, the money will go down the drain,” a department official says. tarn taran brackish water worries villagers    the border villages of valtoha and bhikhiwind are referred to as ‘khara majha’, for their brackish underground water.  in 40 villages, including badharwal, bhaini, baserke, chak bamb, hundal, rajoke, kambo ke, mari, madar and wan tara singh, people prefer to fetch water from hand pumps installed by the water supply and sanitation department.  satnam singh of hundal village says the hand pumps draw water from a depth of 550 ft. “though waterworks have been constructed in several villages, but power supply is erratic. many households do not have water connections.”  officials of the department claim that a survey to link more villages with the water supply chain is in progress and more waterworks are being constructed. farmers have a reason to worry as they claim that the poor quality of underground water is affecting soil health. most of the canal minors have already collapsed due to lack of upkeep and farmers are dependent on groundwater for irrigation.  the collapse of water supply channels has also affected the disposal of waste water. with no underground sewerage, villagers have been dumping waste in overflowing ponds.  at pahuwind village, the area around government primary school is used for disposing of waste water. fazilka water filters not good enough     reverse osmosis (ro) water filter plants have been ineffective in border villages of the district.  in kheowali dhab, the native village of former minister kanshi ram rinwa, no one fetches water from an ro plant. a resident, prithvi raj, says ro plants draw groundwater, which contains a lot of impurities caused by waterlogging.  the population in kheowali dhab and lakhewali dhab villages exceeds 4,000. they depend on waterworks run by the public health and sanitation department on a rotation basis, but have to compromise on water quality.  “we prefer to pay rs250 to rs300 for each container that carries water from gang (bikaner) canal and use it to wash clothes and utensils,” says another villager.  rinwa had, in 1978, shown farsightedness in linking the village pond to a small drain that empties in shehtirwala drain. but over time, encroachments have hampered the water flow.  jandwala meerasangla village was in the news when a squall wreaked havoc in february 2003. former sarpanch bhagwan dass claims that the government released funds to rebuild the village. but ground situation tells a different story. a 2,000-ft pipeline, which was laid to drain out water from the ponds, release water in 25 per cent of houses as no other outlet is available.  there are few takers for ro water as many of the plants are located near public toilets.  villagers demand that ro plants should source water from canals which do not contain as many impurities as underground water. ferozepur streets, drains not a priority here   the sad-bjp government doled out huge sums of money on the development of basic amenities in rural areas, but there little has changed on the ground.  in bhanewala, jalloke, rajoke gatti, kaluwala, chandiwala, khunder gatti, kamale wala and bhakhra villages, residents’ concern is not power or water, but the lack of sewerage.  malkit singh of gatti rajo ke village says, “because of open drains, the condition is unbearable during the monsoon. the drains are flooded and so are the streets.”  water-borne diseases and other ailments are rampant. in some villages, sewerage pipes leak — sewage often flows into water pipes, he adds.  ajit singh, the sarpanch of the village, says funds have not been received for sewerage. “a few years ago, we received funds for the construction of streets,” he said.  the department of water supply and rural sanitation has constructed waterworks, but many panchayats have been asked to fend for themselves.  the absence of street lights is another concern. “it is difficult for elderly persons to roam in the village after dusk,” says bagga singh.  the administration got solar lights installed last year, but none of them are functional, said bittu of tendiwala village. amritsar high arsenic content   high concentration of arsenic in underground water is the bane of amritsar district. tests by several agencies have recorded the highest concentration of arsenic in the district of punjab.  ask officials of the department of water supply and sanitation (dwss) and they simply claim that drinking water is supplied to all villages of the district. they don’t talk about the arsenic content. and they do not have an action plan to address the problem.  of the 878 villages in the district, 391 face water quality issues. in all, 338 villages have high concentration of arsenic in underground water.  a large number of residents of borders villages in ramdas, ajnala and attari blocks are dependent on hand pumps and submersible pumps. the overhead water supply tanks in many villages have been lying defunct.  ramandeep singh of granthgarh village says, “the residents in small villages beyond the ravi and those living in behaks (farmhouses) do not have water supply connections.”  the dwss had laid sewerage in three villages of the district under a world-bank-aided project. there is no state scheme for sewerage in villages.  the inhabitants of border villages are generally concerned with power supply during the paddy season.  in spite of tall claims of surplus power, uninterrupted supply is a distant dream for residents here.  rattan singh, a farmer union leader, says: “we have to gherao the subdivisional offices of the pspcl to get eight-hour of supply for tubewells every year. unscheduled cuts are the order of the day, even in winters.” inputs by ravi dhaliwal, manmeet singh gill, raj sadosh, anirudh gupta and charanjit

november 2  education is in a shambles in villages of punjab’s border belt. vacancies have not been filled for years, defying the guidelines of the right to education (rte) act. the less said about infrastructure the better.  of the 16 education blocks in gurdaspur district, eight are located along the border with pakistan. the staff strength is skeletal in these blocks. at bhalonwali village middle school in fatehgarh churian block, there is just one teacher who teaches all subjects to 50 students.  at rattan abdal village high school, dera baba nanak, there are three teachers for 145 students.  amarjit shastri, a union leader, said petty politics had ruined the education system. “since independence, gurdaspur district has had seven education ministers. all catered to their respective vote banks,” he added.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });  in 2012, then education minister sewa singh sekhwan used rs1 crore from the sports quota to get a stadium constructed near a private school owed by him in his native village.  incumbent education minister aruna chaudhary added the science and commerce streams in darbar pandori senior secondary school, but did not allocate adequate staff. it falls in dinanagar assembly segment, which she represents.  “the ministers upgraded the schools, but did not recruit staff,” shastri alleged.  “within an 8-km radius of gurdaspur, there is no staff shortage. but outside, schools operate at just 40 per cent of their strength. no one wants to get posted in the border belt,” he added.  many buildings were constructed just to avail central funds under the rashtriya madhyamik shiksha abhiyan (rmsa) and sarva shiksha abhiyan (ssa) — without recruiting/deputing teachers.  in pathankot, there are 150 teachers who share cabs to reach their places of posting in dera baba nanak and sri hargobindpur. “as there is no proper transfer policy, teachers spend hours commuting,” said a senior officer. pathankot deo ravinder kumar said a grant would be used to purchase desks. other infrastructure will have to wait as the department is short of funds, he added. amritsar one teacher for 170 students   in a blatant violation of the rte act, which stipulates that the pupil-teacher ratio should be 30:1 (primary) and 35:1 (upper primary), it’s as high as 170:1 in class viii of government senior secondary school, balharwal, 40 km from the city.  just 3 km from the international border, this school has nine teachers for 1,145 students. thirty posts are vacant and there is no science teacher.  burewal village’s manjit singh said his two children were studying in the government school at balharwal village as he couldn’t afford to send them to a private school. here, 12 teachers are imparting education to 392 students.  as many as 377 posts of teachers are lying vacant in the education blocks of ajnala i, ajnala-ii, chogawan-i, chogawan-ii and attari.  government elementary school, aliwal village, is a single-room structure with 51 students. a teacher procured plastic chairs to spare toddlers the trouble of sitting on the floor.  government middle school, gurala village, has two teachers for 141 students.  many schools have to use wood and cow dung as fuel to provide mid-day meals as one lpg cylinder is insufficient for a month’s cooking. tarn taran primary schools turn day-care centres   primary schools resemble day-care centres in the absence of teachers. in most primary schools in khalra, pupils of five classes sit together.  there are just two teachers in most schools, one regular and the other hired under the employment guarantee scheme (egs), alternative innovative education (aie) and special trainer (str) programmes. the primary school at khalra has two regular teachers for 134 students. the building is old and its courtyard gets flooded during the monsoon. the teachers have pooled money to get a water tank installed.  at dodhe village, there is one regular teacher and one ‘str’ for 80 students. at amishah village, there are two teachers for 90 students.  the border belt has over 100 teachers from abohar, fazilka and mansa who were appointed recently. many of them admitted they were trying hard to get a posting back home.  “the standard of education in the border areas is pitiful. our children are barely semi-literate,” said satwant singh, a retired teacher from bhikhiwind. deo balbir singh maini said, “teacher shortage would end after the process of rationalisation is completed.” ferozepur crossing river to reach campus   malkeet singh of kaluwala village a student of class x, gets up at 3 am every day. after helping his father in early-morning chores, he starts for school at 6 am. it takes two hours to reach the campus at gatti rajo ke village after crossing the sutlej on a wooden bera (raft), followed by a brisk 4-km walk.  his is not an isolated case. there are several teenagers who follow this exhausting routine. located a few 100 metres from the border, government senior secondary school, gatti rajoke, is the only school up to class xii which caters to almost a dozen villages. “i joined a few months ago and was pained to see the plight of these poor kids. the dropout rate was high and bunking was the norm,” said satinder singh, principal.  “i counselled parents who wanted their kids to help them in the fields,” he added. there are 11 teachers against 28 sanctioned posts in the school.  teaching aids are a luxury. so is the availability of drinking water and clean toilets.  paras khullar, centre head teacher, government middle school, rahime ke village, rues that there are just four teachers for 160 students. the pupil-teacher ratio is 55:3 at the jhugge hajara school, 133:4 at rajo ke village, 88:1 at tindiwala, 159:4 at gatti rahime ke, 50:1 at bhakhra, 126:4 at chandiwala, 90:3 at khunder gatti and 140:5 at hussainiwala.  commuting is a problem for the teachers posted here. many of them have to board and de-board three buses, besides walking a few km to reach the campus. at times, they have to hire cabs and autos. those who get posted are angling for a transfer, confided a teacher.  the schools don’t have funds for the mid-day meal for the past three months. “i don’t know how we will keep feeding the kids,” says khullar.  malkit singh, deo (secondary), admitted that staff crunch was a perennial problem. fazilka ‘upgraded’ schools worst-affected   the upgrade of high schools to senior secondary in august 2016 has largely been only on paper.  shortage of classrooms, benches, potable water and vacancies of lecturers paint a gloomy picture in the border villages of fazilka district.  at hasta kalan village, students bring jute bags (taat) from home or just sit on the floor, braving the vagaries of weather. “as many as 200 students are forced to sit in the open,” a teacher said. five more rooms are required to seat the students.  “there is no water to drink as the groundwater is saline,” said barjinder singh of class xi.  at government senior secondary school, jhangar bhaini village, a stone’s throw from the border, there are five rooms for 725 students. a block of nine rooms has already been declared unsafe. as per official sources, 21 posts of history, 20 of political science, 19 of punjabi, 10 of economics and six of biology are vacant in 68 senior secondary schools of the district.  “the vacancies will be filled and infrastructure strengthened soon,” said deo om parkash jain. inputs by ravi dhaliwal, neeraj bagga, manmeet singh gill,

(follow the tribune on facebook; and twitter @thetribunechd)(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });  reluctance, awareness, and poverty of the farmers has been the first obstacle in all efforts and techniques developed thus far by punjab agricultural university (pau), ludhiana. lack of funds has also hobbled much research.  progressive farmer kamaldeep singh of sultanpur lodhi says the high cost of a baler (rs 10-12 lakh) — used to make bundles of straw — is crippling. while most of the wheat straw is used for fodder, it is not the case with paddy. since the machine would be idle for most part of the year, a farmer will not be able to pay the loan instalments for it. even if someone uses it, how will he dispose of the bales of hay? there is little market or storage space for it. therefore, kamaldeep singh says, the farmer has hardly any option other than burning it on site.  then there is the happy seeder, which can sow wheat (subsequent crop) even with paddy stubble still standing in the field. but that does not help the potato farmers, who have to clear the field of all farm residue. mulchers — which shred and plough stubble into the field — are a big help, but these have to be pulled by high-power tractors, which raises the cost of the tractor as well as fuel, something the debt-ridden farmers are wary of.  the problem of straw burning is felt more acutely in winter, and that is not from paddy but wheat. regarding this, bakshish singh of dudwindi village says the straw management system (sms), which scatters shredded stubble in the field, is also impractical since the straw does not decompose easily, and labourers transplanting paddy (subsequent crop) are reluctant to work in such fields as they work barefoot. farmers also end up wasting more water by keeping the fields flooded for the straw to decompose. the very purpose of delaying the paddy season by two weeks is then defeated, he explained.  dr js mahal, dean, college of agriculture engineering and technology, pau, says farmers have not shown interest in adopting the happy seeder. that is because the gains of this technology — in the form of better soil health — becomes evident only after three or four years.  in 2012, the university had promoted production biogas from paddy stubble by dry fermentation. “it is an effective technique and the residue left is used as manure, but again the costs are high. the state announced a subsidy but that too failed to attract the farmers,” says dr bs sooch, senior research scientist.  dr rk gupta, senior soil chemist, department of soil sciences, points to another technique, “biochar” produced from stubble. it is now being publicised by krishi vigyan kendras (kvks) at ladowal, jalandhar, amritsar, gurdaspur and bathinda. this technique reduces pollution and the use of the residue improves soil health, improves water infiltration rate as well as water holding capacity of the soil.  the centre too has chipped in on the paddy straw problem. union oil minister dharmendra pradhan announced on november 11, 2016, that a new plant to produce ethanol to be set up in bathinda with an outlay of rs 500 crore. the plant was to convert paddy residue into ethanol, which would provide additional income to farmers. the then deputy chief minister, sukhbir singh badal, had said such plants would be set up in every district in league with private players. he added this initiative would give farmers an extra rs 3,000-4,000 per acre.  the foundation stone of the plant was laid in december 2016, but since the change of government the fate of the project is not known.  it is clear the challenge lies at the wider interface of governance and technology. yet, the initiative of a reward has received appreciation for at least triggering fresh interest in the critical subject."

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });“we understand that in every district in the country, video-conferencing is now available. wherever such facility is available, it ought to be fully utilised and all high courts ought to issue appropriate administrative instructions to regulate the use of video-conferencing for certain category of cases.  “matrimonial cases, where one of the parties resides outside court’s jurisdiction, are one of such categories. wherever one or both the parties make a request for use of video-conference, proceedings may be conducted on video-conferencing, obviating the need of the party to appear in person. in several cases, this court has directed recording of evidence by video-conferencing,” the bench of justice adarsh kumar goel and justice uday umesh lalit ruled. it observed one could not ignore the problem faced by a husband, if the proceedings were transferred due to genuine difficulties faced by a wife. the husband may find it difficult to contest proceedings at a place convenient to the wife. transfer, as such, was not always a solution acceptable to both parties.  “it may be appropriate that the available technology of video-conferencing is used where both parties have equal difficulty and there is no place which is convenient to both parties.”  the bench said every district court was required have an e-mail id and a designated officer/manager of a district court may suitably respond to such e-mail.

 shifted to the complex over a decade ago, the dairy owners are a disillusioned lot. they call themselves the government’s forgotten vote bank, conveniently pushed out of the city with promises of development that were never fulfilled.  anil chander, an entrepreneur, says, “we are residents of urban areas who have set up dairies here. initially, some roads were built, but the kutcha ones are clogged with sewage. some of us also built houses here, only to realise later that it’s just not feasible to live in such surroundings.”  the proposed stp has added fuel to the fire. the hot-button issue became the prime reason for pargat’s exit from the sad as he took up the cudgels on behalf of the villagers. kanwaljit kaur, sarpanch of chitebani village, had threatened to immolate herself last year if the government went ahead with the project. she refuses to budge from her stand: “we won’t allow any politician to enter our village unless they give a written undertaking that the stp will be scrapped. stray animals plunder our crops, the dairy waste chokes our streets and now they want to dump garbage here. we will die before letting that happen. we are backing pargat because he took on the government for our sake.”  to make matters worse, drugs have made inroads into the area in the past few years. former jamsher sarpanch harinder singh bittu shah says, “in the past year, at least seven villagers have succumbed to drugs. and that bad disease (aids) has also reared its ugly head. seven years ago, the sadar police station from the city was shifted here. ironically, the drug menace has tightened its grip since then. we don’t know what the cops are doing.”  the voters of the constituency’s urban area have a different set of problems. their long-pending demands: abolition of ‘undue’ octroi, access to a peripheral road and mobile connectivity.  the cantonments of jalandhar and ferozepur are the only ones in the state where octroi is still being levied. “we’ll get it abolished” — several politicians have used this line to woo voters ahead of one election after the other. the promise was made by sad candidates jagbir brar and pargat singh in the 2007 and 2012 assembly poll, respectively. both won; it was the voters who lost faith.  as per information obtained under the rti act, octroi to the tune of over rs61 crore has been collected from residents over the past decade. harvinder setia, a trader, says, “octroi was abolished across 133 mcs as per the state government’s 2006 gazette notification, which instead levied 10 per cent surcharge on vat. in a 2008 notification, jalandhar and ferozepur cantonment boards were also exempted from paying it. however, dual charges are being imposed on us illegally.”  the boundary walls erected by the army near dhina village and on a stretch at hallotali village have restricted the movement of commuters between the urban and rural areas. the structures have also blocked the link roads meant for inter-village connectivity. locals have been fighting for access to the phirni road for the past many years, with over 100 rti applications being filed. for the time being, they have no option but to make a detour of 6 km or more to reach their destination.  ram sehdev, a local entrepreneur, says, “we have been let down by all parties. pargat did make efforts regarding the peripheral road, but he drew a blank over his 16-point manifesto. we have even approached the centre in vain. it all boils down to political will, which is lacking.”  in the age of smartphones, cantonment residents are heavily dependent on the landline. reason: this is a high-security area where private mobile phone towers are a no-no. still stuck in the 20th century? yes, many of them do feel that way at times."

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });according to wichelns, an improvement in water management will also help in reducing methane emissions and arsenic uptake in the rice fields. “methane is a potent greenhouse gas. it is estimated that up to 20 per cent of the anthropogenic releases of methane to the atmosphere are generated in agriculture, largely by livestock and in rice production,” he said. “the anaerobic conditions in which paddy rice is produced is largely responsible for the methane generation and release. methanogenic organisms, which thrive in anaerobic conditions, break down carbonaceous materials and form methane,” he added. he said rice production generated a substantial amount of methane annually, thus adding notably to the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere each year. switching from flooded paddy production to aerobic rice production or to alternative crops that are produced in aerobic conditions can substantially reduce regional methane emissions, wichelns added. — ians "

the only government senior secondary school, located at sukhomajra village, is 3 km away from the town; and the three roads connecting the town to ropar, fatehgarh sahib and chamkaur sahib are in a dilapidated condition. a portion of the school building was declared unsafe two years ago, following which 11 of its 21 rooms were demolished. however, the malba (debris) has not yet been removed from the campus, forget about constructing new rooms. a staff member says their pleas have fallen on deaf ears, even though education minister daljit singh cheema is an mla from the district.  the sikh community is upset over the government’s failure to nail the culprits responsible for the major incidents of sacrilege last year. jaspreet, a cloth merchant in his twenties, says his family always voted for the sad, but this time they will opt for simranjit singh mann’s sad (amritsar). reason: the powers that be were powerless in curbing desecration. his brother, parmeet, says development works were undertaken by the government in other parts of the state, but this constituency never got its due. the roads and streets are waterlogged during the monsoon as the work of laying sewer lines has been going on for the past many years, he complains.  three demonetisation-hit truck drivers are sitting idle, venting their ire on the police. “we have to pay at every naka while transporting goods. if one dares to refuse, the cops slap us,” says paramjit singh. his colleague, jaswinder singh, says there has been a let-up in extortion by the police from truck drivers in the past few weeks, apparently due to the fast-approaching elections. then he fires the parting shot: “this proves beyond doubt that the government knows it all and the police are simply obeying orders.”"

 he promises that the kapurthala road would get carpeted in a month. “i admit that the sewerage work has got delayed, but once it’s over, the road will be as good as any national highway and people’s problems will become a thing of the past,” he says, already talking like a candidate in the thick of campaigning.  racing against time, the ruling party leaders have tried to woo the industry by setting up a skill development centre for tannery workers at the leather complex, which is likely to be inaugurated in the coming days. “this is the only good thing that has happened to us as we hope to get trained labour. otherwise, it has been years since the drums in the wet units were sealed by the punjab pollution control board and our work capacity has been reduced to less than half. no politician came to our rescue during the tough times,” says raju virk, a tannery owner.  the foundation stone of another skill centre, named after kabir, to train construction workers was laid on the 120-ft road earlier this year. “the work had just started when it was suspended due to a technical glitch in the rs 10-crore project,” alleges congress councillor sushil rinku, a ticket-seeking ravidassia.  a shopkeeper in abadpura locality says bitterly, “if chunni lal has done us no good, his rival, former congress minister mohinder singh kaypee, hasn’t been any better. the latter’s family remained in the saddle for 45-long years. post-delimitation, his house now falls under jalandhar cantonment constituency and he has lost his base here.”  he agrees that some people still have sympathy for kaypee because his mla father darshan singh kaypee was gunned down by militants, but hastens to add that the residents are looking for change this time.  revealing his aap leanings, he says, “most people here, including me, are kabir followers and darshan bhagat is a candidate from our own community,” even as a customer at his shop observes that the recent rally of state aap convener gurpreet singh waraich in favour of the candidate was not exactly a crowd-puller.  the area residents believe that the caste factor will be decisive. “of the about 1.5 lakh voters, half are from the reserved category: 30,000 bhagats, 30,000 ravidassias, 10,000 valmiks and around 5,000 brars. whichever community has two candidates representing the main political parties will suffer as the votes will get divided and the third one will have an edge,” a local politician claims.  vipan kumar, a resident of babrik chowk area, says the scenario is fluid at present. “it’s difficult to say at the moment which way the voters will go. people are still making up their minds.”  for him, the best thing that has happened in the past five years is a mini civil hospital coming up on the 120-ft road. “it was difficult travelling all the way to the civil hospital at the other end of the city. the 30-bed hospital in our area will be a big boon for us,” he says. but he knows that his enthusiasm is not matched by the ground reality. with the code of conduct looming large, the government may not be able to open the hospital, whose basic structure is barely ready. vipan will have to wait indefinitely, something that he and the other voters around him have been doing for years, if not decades."

""a number of factors worked against the monsoon since july-end. there have hardly been low-pressure circulations since then and conditions in the indian and pacific oceans have been unfavourable,"" said d sivananda pai, head of imd's long range monsoon forecasts. imd had forecast normal monsoon this year at 96% of the long period average, which it updated to 98% in june. poor distribution of rainfall has added to the distress. as many as 110 districts have had excess or 'large excess' (over 60% of normal) rainfall. in addition, heavy rain spells in gujarat, rajasthan and catchment areas in the himalayas (particularly in nepal) caused the worst floods in the country in 10 years. ironically, states such as up have seen both flood fury as well as the prospect of drought. the monsoon deficit in west up stands at 37%, highest for any subdivision in the country. of the state's 72 districts, rainfall has been deficient in 48. out of these, five districts — agra, hamirpur, mahamayanagar, amethi and kushinagar — face acute shortfall of 60% or more. this combination of poor rains and floods is likely to hit kharif output, although data till september 8 reveals that the sowing area this year is only marginally less than last year's, with the biggest drops seen in oilseeds, pulses and jute. several state governments have reportedly started drought exercises. poor rains have also affected water storage levels, important for winter crops. according to the central water commission data, live storage at 91 important reservoirs in the country was at 58% of capacity on september 8, the lowest in five years for which data was available. it was lower than the corresponding period during the drought years of 2014 (74%) and 2015 (59%), and significantly below the 10-year average of 69%. imd believes the second half of september could bring better rains in central india. ""while the situation in northwest is not likely to change too much, there are indications that central india may get some rain in the next couple of weeks. monsoon isn't likely to start withdrawing in the next few days,"" pai said."

brahmaputra valley and barak valley) in the state which causes floods. the state faces acute flood problem in the flood plains of the river brahmaputra and barak and other smaller river sub-basins. assam has faced two waves of floods till 19th july 2017 affecting 29 districts out of 33 districts, resulting in loss of human lives, livestock and large scale damage to the dwelling houses. the state government is providing necessary relief assistance affected people in the state. as per information received from the state government of assam, about 59430.45 quintal rice, 11142.18 quintal dal, 3541.71 quintal salt, 37249.89 liters m. oil and 58092 numbers of tarpaulins etc. have been provided to the affected people in different districts of assam. the state government has mentioned that 1160 relief camps (357 relief camps + 803 relief distribution center) have been opened and 1,31,416 inmates are housed in these camps, so far. however, at present the situation is under control in the state. the state government is closely monitoring rescue & relief operations in the districts to deal with any eventuality. the ministry of home affairs is also keeping constant round the clock watch on the situation in the country including assam. in order to assess the loss of immediate nature, upon receipt interim memorandum an inter-ministerial central team (imct) was constituted on 21st july 2017. the inter-ministerial central team, in consultation with the state government, are visiting the affected areas of the state, from 25-28th july 2017 for on the spot assessment of damages of immediate and temporary nature. further, action would be taken in the matter, in accordance with the established procedure. to ensure effective preparedness, mha conducted annual meeting of relief commissioners/ secretaries, department of disaster management of state / uts on 17 may 2017 to review the status of preparedness and to discuss other disaster management related issues. the representatives of various central ministries/ organizations rendering emergency support functions also participated in the meeting. during the conference the emphasis was laid on close coordination with forecasting agencies such as central water commission (cwc), india metrological department (imd), gsi and incois. as stated earlier, the state governments concerned are primarily responsible for undertaking necessary rescue, relief and preventive measures in the wake of natural calamities. apart from providing logistics support, the government of india supplements the efforts of the state governments by extending financial assistance through state disaster response fund (sdrf) and national disaster response fund (ndrf) as per the laid down procedure. an amount of rs. 9382.80 crore has been allocated as central share to all the states in their sdrf accounts for the year 2017-18. an amount of rs. 3387.15 crore has so far been released, as the installment of central share of sdrf for the year 2017-18 to 21 states. in addition, financial assistance from ndrf amounting to rs. 1555.84 crore has been provided during 2017-18, so far, to different states which were affected by calamities of severe nature. in addition to regular schemes of crops damage, the farmers are also entitled for compensation under the pradhan mantri fasal bima yojna of the ministry of agriculture, which is being implemented by the state government. mha have deployed about 88 specialized teams of ndrf in 26 states and uts with 304 boats another necessary search and rescue equipment. based on vulnerability profile of different regions of the country, ndrf teams have been presently stationed/ deployed at 12 bn hq viz; guwahati (assam), haringhata (west bengal), mundali (odisha), arakkonam (tamil nadu), pune (maharashtra), vadodra (gujarat), bhatinda (punjab), ghaziabad (uttar pradesh), bihta (bihar), vijayawada (andhra pradesh), varanasi (uttar pradesh) and doimukh (arunachal pradesh). besides, pre-positioning of the ndrf teams has already been done at 31 different locations in the country depending on the vulnerability profile of the area. in addition, ndrf teams also assist to the state administration in distribution of essential relief material and provide medical support to affected people at the time of emergency. ndrf also conducts mock drills along with the relevant departments and state agencies in the country for effective management of floods, response and rescue operations. hon’ble pm has reviewed the flood preparedness of the nation via pragati on 12th july 2017. hon’ble mos (pmo & doner) has reviewed the flood situation of north-eastern states including assam on 13th july 2017. hon’ble mos (home) has visited and reviewed the flood situation of assam and arunachal pradesh from 13th to 15th july 2017. i would like to assure the hon’ble members that the government of india will give due importance to the valuable suggestions given by them during the discussion to deal effectively with the situation caused by floods and other natural calamities.”"
1166,2017-03-22,https://reliefweb.int/node/1960219,"taking a holistic approach to water management  story highlights two-thirds of india is prone to droughts and one-eight is susceptible to floods. india’s complex hydrology calls for a holistic approach. the two hydrology projects have helped several communities in vulnerable areas to plan in advance and build resilience against the uncertainties of climate change. down the ages, droughts and floods have stalked the vast indian landmass. often, these specters go hand in hand, playing out their macabre spectacle in rapid succession. for, many a time, after a long scorching summer parches the land, dark monsoon clouds roll in from the sea, and the heavens disgorge their largesse with an unrelenting fury. year in year out, droughts and floods take an unforgiving toll. two-thirds of india is prone to droughts and one-eight is susceptible to floods. surging flood waters afflict some 32 million people each year, robbing the economy of anything between rs 6000 crore and rs 12,000 crores. drought affects a further 150 million people. although india as a whole is not a water scarce country, its water is unevenly distributed across both seasons and regions. some areas have too much water while others have too little. and, not all the water is available when it is needed most. add to this the increasing intensity of droughts and floods, as well as a rapidly growing population, and the impacts of these twin specters is becoming larger by the day. with half of india’s annual precipitation falling in just 15 rain-soaked days, droughts and floods are likely to remain a fact of life in the country,” explains anju gaur, senior water specialist at the world bank in new delhi. “the only way out is to fundamentally change the way we manage things.” it’s not so much a water crisis as a water management crisis clearly, india’s complex hydrology calls for a holistic approach. for a start, floods are not caused by heavy rains alone. the situation is often compounded by weak water management systems, faulty urban design, or rivers that have been unduly constrained by bunds and encroachments. quite often, floods are caused by the sudden release of water from reservoirs. “take the floods in bihar in 2016, in odisha in 2011, or the floods in the krishna river in andhra pradesh in 1998 that affected more than 2 million people,” says gaur. “most of these occurred in late august or september, when the reservoirs were full. when more rain fell, reservoir operators got just a few hours to release the excess water to prevent a breach, or else there would have been even more devastation downstream.” the main issue is that, until now, reservoir operators did not have the technological tools to help them take crucial decisions. rather, they were required to abide by strict schedules for the release of water that were often laid down in colonial times. if you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it now, for the first time in india, two hydrology projects – hydrology i (1995-2003) and hydrology ii (2006-2014) – supported by the world bank, have introduced new systems and technology that give reservoir managers an accurate picture of the water situation unfolding in their region. these systems have also laid the foundation for a comprehensive knowledge base that can improve the overall management of water resources in the country. “reliable data is a must for making better decisions,” says gaur. “this is especially important when you are dealing with such large volumes of water, as even small mistakes can have huge consequences.” ""with half of india’s annual precipitation falling in just 15 rain-soaked days, droughts and floods are likely to remain a fact of life in the country. the only way out is to fundamentally change the way we manage things."" - anju gaur, senior water specialist at the world bank making information travel faster than flood water the first project – hydrology 1 – focused on the peninsular states, where most rivers are straddled by a series of reservoirs (the western ghats in maharashtra alone are dotted with more than 1,800 reservoirs and barrages of both large and medium sizes). the second project extended its reach to cover the two water-rich northern states of punjab and himachal pradesh. to better manage water flows from these reservoirs, new systems now monitor all the important aspects of the hydro-meteorological cycle. measurement begins high up in the catchments of rivers, where digital gauges measure how much rain or snow has fallen, how rapidly the snow is melting, the speed with which the water is flowing, how much silt has built up, how much water will reach the reservoir, how soon it will do so, and so on. sensors in the field instantly transmit this information to data centres through satellite or mobile phone technology, enabling managers to form a clear picture of the water situation unfolding in their region. while these systems have been installed across peninsular india, the bhakra beas and the krishna-bhima systems have gone a step further. they now have a modelling tool that helps them predict water flows into their reservoirs three days in advance. this means that the lead time for planning the release of water from these reservoirs has shot up from just hours to days. “earlier it took lots of manpower and at least 24 hours to process this information from the field. not surprisingly, engineers often ended up doing a post-mortem of a flood rather than pre-empting one,” recalls gaur. now, whenever it rains heavily, reservoir managers can start releasing water slowly so that the reservoirs remain full while there is no risk to dam safety and no damage downstream. advance information is particularly important for the shorter peninsular rivers where it barely takes a few hours for the water to travel from the catchment to the reservoir. “sangli town in maharashtra, for instance, used to have flash floods whenever there was a sudden release of water from the koyna dam upstream,” gaur adds. “now this no longer happens.” these reservoir management systems, which cost a total of rs 30 crores, have helped avert flood damages of over rs. 238 crores. and, the results are there for all to see. in 2010, for instance, punjab, a highly flood-prone state, experienced some of the worst floods in its history, taking a huge toll on life and property. but, in 2013, when the rivers were in similar spate, no floods took place and there was no damage. this is not to say that floods will no longer happen, explains gaur. if the rains are unduly heavy, floods may well take place, but advance warning can certainly help save lives. these systems can also help alleviate the harshest impact of droughts. “a full reservoir is the best cushion against a drought in the dry season,” says gaur. “thanks to these systems, 2015 was the first time that all the krishna basin reservoirs in maharashtra were full by the end of the monsoon.” mapping groundwater with groundwater levels depleting at an alarming rate, the second project – hydrology 2 – used advanced geophysical techniques with helicopter-borne instruments to pilot the mapping of aquifers in five states – rajasthan, bihar, maharashtra, karnataka and tamil nadu. the technology is not only much faster and more accurate than other methods, but is also much cheaper. “groundwater modeling is an extremely complex subject,” explains gaur. “once the mapping is complete, we will get a much clearer picture of the groundwater resources in a region. it will also help in designing the best methods to recharge and manage this precious resource.” closer magnification can also throw up a host of new issues. “until now our information was on a scale of 1:250,000. once it is reduced to 1:50,000 or better, who knows what will come to light?” gaur adds. since water quality has emerged as another critical issue, the second project also helped states identify where the quality of groundwater has been affected by fluorides, nitrates, and other contaminants. monitoring water quality the second hydrology project also piloted water quality monitoring in surface water sources. thirteen real-time water quality monitoring stations were set up on the ganga and yamuna rivers. these stations proved extremely useful in maintaining water quality during the kumbh mela in 2013 when millions of people took the ritual dip in the holy river. real time readings from these stations helped determine when water needed to be released upstream on critical bathing days, and when it needed treatment. today, these stations continue to play their role on both these rivers, especially upstream and downstream of the capital, delhi. given the usefulness of these stations, 111 more such stations are being planned along the main ganga river. managing competing demands for water the systems and technology introduced under the two hydrology projects have much broader applications too. “if we are to manage our exceedingly complex web of water resources effectively, we need to know how much water the country has, when it has it, and where it has it,” clarifies gaur. “without accurate data on the existing water situation in the country, we are really shooting in the dark.” water data can also be a critical input in making development decisions. in pune, for example, a planned tunnel between two reservoirs to improve the city’s water supply was abandoned for a simpler, better and cheaper solution. accurate water data also provides a scientific basis on which to manage competing demands for river water, especially as disputes are often sparked by the lack of correct information. “accurate data can not only guide the sharing of river waters but also be used to better manage the fragile ecology of a river basin, help with better water resources planning and allocation during lean periods, design flood protection works, and so on,” explains chabungbam rajagopal singh, water resources management specialist at the world bank in new delhi. a third hydrology project, supported by the world bank, will now expand the water resources monitoring system to cover the entire country, including the indus, ganga, and brahmaputra-barak river basins. under this project, the ministry of water resources will provide states with a grant to collect water data for each river, stream and reservoir in their territory. the importance of sharing water data “importantly, we need to move beyond mere data collection to using it more effectively. for this, the willingness of organizations to open up their data and make it transparent will be the key, explains gaur. in addition, water resources institutions will need to be brought under one umbrella with one single agency to manage both ground and surface water. engineers and scientists will also need to evolve into water managers and take a river basin-wide approach to manage all water resources in an integrated manner. more importantly, riparian states and other stakeholders will need to come together to plan the allocation of river water during a dry year, a wet year and a year of normal rainfall, while being ready for climate change. “overall, the real and tangible benefits of the systems established under the two hydrology projects include people whose lives, homes, and crops are saved due to improved flood forecasting, farmers who benefit from improved irrigation supplies, and children who do not fall ill or worse from drinking contaminated water,” said halla maher qaddumi, senior water economist at the world bank in new delhi. “over time, it is hoped that accurate water data will also help reduce conflict between people and states over shared water resources.” leaders in transparency · the central water commission has created a state of the art platform that publicly shares national level water data online. · maharashtra shares real time water information together with streamflow forecasts, and audits water use by various sectors for each major/ medium reservoir. this is published annually on the web. · others states too are devising interim arrangements to display water information and joining the central platform on water resources information, while still others are yet to follow. · transparency is equally important for groundwater too. for, unlike surface water bodies which are managed by the government, the management of groundwater lies primarily in the hands of the people. andhra pradesh has been the first off the block in this, posting monthly bulletins and real time information on the groundwater situation on the chief minister’s web portal. · gujarat too is conducting an indepth analysis of the groundwater situation, particularly around the cities, to meet growing urban demand. · going forward both the centre and states will need to join hands to develop a sound national water resources information system and agree to make it accessible."

climatic low pressure area which lay centred over coastal tamil nadu unleashed heavy showers ina continuous spree in tamil nadu during this northeast monsoon from the first week of november and has only abated on the 4th of december. so far there has been three spells of intensive rainfall. the first intensive spell of rainfall was from 8th and 9th november, followed by intensive rains again on 15th, 16th and 17th november. the first spell witnessed intensive flooding in cuddalore where most of the water bodies were full and the associated breaching affected the community’s life damaging house, infrastructure, etc. during the first spell the city of chennai experienced minor flooding to moderate flooding. the second spell saw chennai going out of gear as many settlements in chennai were flooded. the impacts of this spell stretched beyond chennai to adjoining district to chennai namely kancheepuram and tiruvallur, though the impacts in kancheepuram and tiruvallur was less compared to chennai. the third spell which is still on going has been more intensive than the first two spells and the impacts has exacerbated the flooding severely. this time chennai city was badly hit with nonstop rains, in some areas the flood water level was almost six feet high. entire neighbourhoods have been flooded, homes, shops and other establishments deluged. people have been marooned in the upper floors of homes.. many had to remain inside their houses without electricity as the whole city was flooded. people have been rescued and evacuated from the flooded areas by boats. the army airdropped food and water packets to the stranded families. the attributing reason for the same has been due to the heavy downpour on one side and the low level of water absorbtion capacity in view of the continuous rains since november first week. the process has completely thrown out of gear the normal life of people in many districts in tamil nadu. so far nearly 400 people have died and over 1.8 million people have been displaced. non-stop torrential rains since monday night (30.11.2015) pounded several parts of chennai and north tamil nadu triggering a deluge completely disrupting normal life as army was deployed today in two suburban areas to undertake rescue on a war footing.the flood situation continues to remain grim in the city and several parts of tamil nadu. the city still remains virtually cut off from the rest of the country with air, rail and road transport services. according to reports, chennai faces acute shortage of necessary items while the price of food grains sky rocket due to shortage. residents have complained about lack of medicines, milk, potable water and vegetables. meanwhile, indian naval ship ins airavat has reached chennai with relief materials. the government has deployed 1200 ndrf personnel, 100 boats and 200 divers to rescue stranded people in flood-hit areas. 40 army teams, 6 navy teams with 12 boats and several relief teams have been deployed in chennai to intensify rescue and relief operations. in several places, power supply and communication lines are down, adding to the misery. speaking to india today television, national disaster response force director general o p singh said 5 teams from patna and guwahati will soon leave for chennai while 5 teams from punjab have already reached chennai. another 5 teams from pune are all set to leave for chennai. some 164,000 people have been housed in 460 camps in chennai, cuddalore, thiruvallur and kanchipuram districts while thousands have also been shifted to others' houses after water entered theirs. at least 269 people have been killed to due to rain and flood related incidents in tamil nadu where thousands have become homeless. keeping in view the situation, chief ministerj. jayalalithaa has urged prime minister narendramodi to declare the unprecedented crisis a national disaster. chennai has suffered unprecedented destruction, with water overflowing from rivers and reservoirs seeping into scores of apartments and houses, markets, shopping malls, offices and educational institutions, unsettling life like never before. the floods have also killed 54 in neighboring andhra pradesh and two in pondicherry. a green body on friday said that the floods in chennai are an impact of climate change and the ""unprecedented deluge"" that the city has witnessed is a reminder of increasing frequency of such freak weather events across the indian subcontinent. the centre for science and environment (cse) said that chennai could have fared better if it had protected and preserved its natural water bodies and drainage channels. prime minister narendra modi on last thursday (3.11.2015) flew to chennai to take stock of the flood situation. after an aerial survey, he met with tamil nadu chief minister j. jayalalithaa and announced rs.1,000crore (us$ 151,515,151.52) for tamil nadu flood relief. he said this is in addition to the rs. 940

""even after 20 days of floods, the foul smell of rotten bodies of animals had filled the atmosphere. this could have led to outbreak of epidemics,"" he said. two main medical colleges of the state - government medical college and hospital and jvc medical college and hospital, both at srinagar - were reeling under water. the infrastructure of the hospital, including costly equipment, was destroyed. the entire wholesale market of medicines was completely submerged in water. the alternative arrangement of doctors and medicines was not in proportion to the amount required,"" said dr shakeel. there was also huge shortage of doctors, because native doctors of kashmir were themselves reeling under floods and hence not available for duty. nonetheless, many voluntary organizations were working there, he said."

1190,2014-09-01,https://reliefweb.int/node/688081,"monsoon delivers a hard blow to farmers  flood and drought - farmers across the country have seen both as this year’s monsoon has featured late and erratic rains. this report details the situation as it is on the ground. high food inflation has been pinching indians for the last few months and with the current monsoon not being very generous to farmers, the situation is only expected to worsen. as of august 29th, rainfall deficiency in the country was 18 per cent, a much improved figure from the 41 per cent deviation recorded at the start of monsoon. this was all thanks to heavy showers, which also led to floods in odisha, assam and bihar. the indian meteorological department (imd) downgraded its prediction for overall rainfall deficiency from 7 per cent to 13 per cent, which brings the country closer to drought. a drought is declared when overall deficiency is more than 10 per cent and over 20 per cent of country’s area is affected by drought-like conditions. imd is still hoping for the figures to improve by the time the clouds recede from the country in september. most of the northwest, which makes the maximum contribution to the nation’s granaries, has not had much rainfall. the decline ranges from 65 per cent in the case of punjab to 40 per cent in eastern uttar pradesh. western rajasthan and vidarbha, two of the most water-stressed regions of india known for distress migration and farmer suicides respectively, are staring at a greater crisis if the current trend of deficient rainfall continues. by august 29, kharif crops were sown in 966.25 lakh hectares. last year, the figure was 998.01 lakh hectares during the same period. the major drop in acreage has been for coarse cereals, oilseeds and pulses. the centre has raised to 50 per cent the subsidy ceiling to buy seeds from the existing level. at present, seed subsidy is given in the range of rs 1,500-5,000 per quintal under the national food security mission depending on the varieties of seeds to partially compensate farmers for re-sowing crops in drought-declared areas. however, none of the states has declared drought yet. “drought has become a political issue in india. if a state government declares drought, it has to pay 50 per cent of the relief amount to the farmers before the centre releases its share. today, each state wants a relief package but without having to shell out anything,” sharma says. the major reservoirs of the country were filled to less than two thirds of their total capacity (155.05 billion cubic metres) on august 21, which is 85 per cent down from last year. this will not only impact irrigation of both the kharif and rabi crops, but will also impact the production of power, some of which is again used for irrigation through tubewells.

""we're despatching about 35 to 40 small relief trucks daily. however, if there are roadblocks in the distribution process, we do not know of it,"" said manu bhardwaj, a volunteer at the sports college storage camp in raipur, dehradun. government officials confirmed they had received over 400 large relief trucks since june 22 when supplies started pouring in from various parts of the country. additional rations are still coming in from gujarat, punjab and haryana. ""we were told rations will be distributed to us on wednesday, thursday and friday. however, the days passed without any relief,"" said arvind sharma, resident of flood-hit pandukeshwar village. in mana, the last indian village along the indo-tibetan border, only 40 of the 200 families said they have received their share of relief. a tea-stall owner, bhawani, said, ""although the administration announced it has completed the distribution of relief material to mana, we've no such information."" also, contrary to its promise of reaching relief to every family, the government is handing over supplies to tehsildars and village sarpanchs, leading to allegations of discrepancy and biased distribution. expressing satisfaction with the way the government has handled relief though, revenue secretary bhaskaranand joshi said, ""the government was focusing on getting pilgrims out first. relief will follow."" supplies for flood-hit people include food grains, clothes, ready-to-eat food, used and new clothes and utensils, among other things. although large quantities of bottled mineral water are also being supplied, volunteers managing relief camps said this is mostly needed in uttarkashi. describing the government's decision to send in mineral water as shortsighted, joint advisor, operations, at the national disaster management authority, vinay kajla, said, ""instead of bottled water, the government should have sent in a water filtration or treatment system. no one seems to have thought what will happen once relief supplies dry up and people are forced to return to the old sources of drinking water. in places like the kedar valley, the risk of water contamination will be high."""

1309,2012-07-23,https://reliefweb.int/node/512568,"preparations for monsoon  the central government has prepared extensive plans to deal with the deficiency in the monsoon/rainfall in some parts of the country.  the government is in full readiness to address any situation that may arise due to any rainfall anomalies.  the prime minister has been apprised of the situation and has directed all departments and ministries to co-ordinate efforts with state governments to meet any eventuality and monitor the situation on a weekly basis. situation so far the progress of the monsoon so far has not allayed earlier concerns.  the rainfall deficiency which existed at  the end of june has lessened somewhat, but the intensity and spread of rainfall over the next week or so needs to be watched carefully, especially in karnataka, maharashtra, gujarat and rajasthan the india meteorological department's second stage forecast on 22.6.2012 predicted rainfall over the whole monsoon season to be normal at 96% of long period average (lpa) with model error of ±4%, but this is now reportedly likely to be around the lower end of the range.  as on 15.7.2012, monsoon has covered all parts of the country.  the cumulative rainfall for the period from 01.06.2012 to 15.07.2012 is 22% less than the lpa.  rainfall over the four geographical regions of north-west, central, south peninsula and east and north-east india for this period has been lower than their lpas by 33%, 26%. 26% and 10% respectively.  punjab, haryana, rajasthan, saurashtra and karnataka have till now received low rainfall.  on the other hand, the north east region, north bihar and north bengal have received and are likely to continue to receive heavy rainfall.  the overall figure of 22% deficit can, however, be misleading as the unevenness of distribution and periodicity of rainfall are also factors to be taken into account. the 84 major reservoirs in the country that are being monitored by central water commission have now begun to get filled but the current year storage is still 61% of last year storage and 78% normal ten-year average storage.  however the levels in the reservoirs in madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh and rajasthan are more than the ten yearly average.  the ministry of water resources indicates that there is no real cause for concern as the reservoirs are now getting filled with heavy rains in the foothills of himalayas, north-east and parts of southern india. there has been reduction of around eight million hectares in the crop area sown compared to last year. while the reduction in area sown in case of rice could be covered over time,  area reduction in coarse cereals is likely to persist. steps taken: a. contingency plans have been prepared by the department of agriculture and cooperation and shared with the states.  these will be rolled out in the areas which continue to receive low rainfall. b. there is sufficient availability of all seeds including of coarse cereals and pulses.  in assam, which is affected by flood, seeds of submergence tolerant varieties are being provided.  similarly, for flood prone north bihar and west bengal, sufficient seeds and such varieties are available. c. suitable advisories regarding fodder availability have been issued in the states by the department of animal husbandry, dairying and fisheries.  these include preservation of crop residue that may be used as fodder in the nest season.  sufficient funds for this purpose are available with the state governments under various schemes. d. sufficient seeds for various fodder crops such as maize, sorghum and bajra are available and will be made available to the state governments, as and when required. e. all options for increasing fodder availability under joint forest management programme will be explored by the ministry of environment and forests. f. power availability for agricultural purposes will be ensured so that yield of rice is not adversely affected.  unallocated power of approximately 300 mw each is being made available to punjab, haryana and up by the ministry of power.  this represents about 75% of the total unallocated power available for the northern region.  in addition, secretary, ministry of petroleum and natural gas has been asked to ensure availability of diesel in the states, especially in north west india. g. the need for according the highest priority to drinking water was stressed. the ministry of drinking water & sanitation will henceforth be monitoring the status of the affected habitations on a weekly basis, rather than on a fortnightly basis as is presently being done. h. adequate reservation for drinking water in the reservoirs will be ensured. states have been advised to phase out the release of reservoir water for irrigation in a way that in the event of there being less rainfall later on further requests can be met. i. while the prices of wheat and rice are stable, the prices of sugar, pulses and vegetable are showing an upward trend.  a proposal for increase in subsidy for supply of pulses through public distribution system to bpl families is being brought before cabinet committee on economic affairs by the ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution. j. any additional requirement for wages under the mgnrega scheme will be met by the department of rural development.  rs.12,000 crore have already been released to the states during the current year.  states have sufficient funds in hand.  increase in demand for employment has been reported only from a few states so far.  the shelf of works to absorb additional labour has been kept ready with the states. k. sufficient funds to the tune of rs.4524 crore are currently available under national disaster relief fund. l. an inter-ministerial group under secretary, department of agriculture and cooperation is reviewing the situation on a weekly basis and also holding video conference with the state governments."

""we have completed our all preparations for flood control and cleaned up all season rivulets in the district,"" claimed patiala dc g k singh after a meeting of flood coordination committee. however, there are no takers for the official claims. ""we have not seen any cleaning of any rivulet,"" said some farmers working in field near devigarh. the dc is apparently completely unaware about the agitation and signature campaign launched by residents of tafajalpura, gurbax colony, guru nanak nagar, new bishan nagar, purana bishan nagar, deen dyal upadhya nagar, ram nagar, sst nagar, mathura colony, jagdish colony and many other areas last sunday to protest against the lack of cleaning of chhoti nadi. the residents have now decided to approach the chief minister for the cleaning of chhoti nadi as they fear that it may not only cause floods but also lead to an outbreak of epidemic because of the dirty sewage water discharged in it. ""the administration is lying. we request the punjab chief minister to take strict action against all officers, who have sent fake reports of cleaning and order a high level inquiry to know the utilization of funds,"" they demanded. sources said there are around 17 drains in patiala and many other seasonal rivulets and rivers like ghaggar, tangri, markanda and pachi dara. in 2010, lack of cleaning had led to around 50 breaches, which led to floods and losses of rs 63 crores in 200 villages of patiala. estimates prepared by the district drainage department reveal that it needs at least rs 6.50 crores for the repair and cleaning of water channels."

""injustice is being meted out to residents of about two dozen villages already living at the mercy of the authorities` attitude as the construction of the wall along hansi-butana in four-km area would ensure flooding of these villages completely,"" said ghaggar control committee chairman jugraj singh hotipur. hotipur said it was suggested long back that haryana be allowed to use ghaggar water from hansi-butana regulator during paddy season, but no heed was given to the suggestion. makrod sahib resident joginder singh said people had still not forgotten floods of 2010 and with the construction of hansi butana wall they would have to face more such problems, as at that time, some of the water had spread into haryana allowing the flood`s intensity to come down. he added that construction of the wall would prove disastrous for many punjabi villages and if state authorities did not come forward in saving villages, they would be ruined if ghaggar showed its fury. state irrigation minister janmeja singh sekhon said punjab would oppose the wall`s construction strongly and the matter would soon be raised before union government."

''it's shameful how governments blame farmers for causing breaches, even threatening to book us. are we supposed to stand and watch while our children starve and crops died. the water has to be drained out and so we have cut roads or diverted flood waters to empty channels. no government has come to help us,"" said kultar singh, a patiala village farmer. meanwhile, both states have made a case for huge compensation packages from the central government - haryana's astounding rs 1,346.81 crore and punjab's preliminary estimate of rs 300 crore even as assessment is still on in sangrur and mansa districts. punjab has also demanded damages of rs 10,000 against the existing rs 1,600 per acre of crop loss."

and with the world health organization, networks of people living with hiv, government ministries and civil society organizations under the regional health and care programmes. the south asia regional office also maintained strong cooperation with the international committee of the red cross (icrc) and links with the world food programme, united nations development programme (undp) and united nations agency for international development (usaid). further, close cooperation was continued with international media agencies like reuters, bbc and cnn for efficient information flow, especially during disasters. the international federation, on behalf of the national societies in the south asia region, would like to thank the above mentioned partners for their generous support."

1443,2008-08-29,https://reliefweb.int/node/278448,"india: floods - information bulletin n° 4  glide fl-2008-000145-ind the state of bihar is facing one of the worst floods in 50 years, as the river kosi in nepal has discharged huge levels of water, running down to the bordering districts of bihar and inundating them. a two kilometre long breach in the mud embankment has led to a change in the course of the river kosi, which has caused this flooding, including inundation of those districts in bihar which have not been affected by floods in past 50 years. so far, 2.6 million people have been affected in the state and 47 people killed(1) since the breach occurred earlier this week. the state administration was not adequately prepared to handle such a situation. presently the interagency group in the state and the government are mobilising resources to combat the situation in the state and to set up an emergency relief operation. the indian red cross society (ircs) has taken a lead, with its trained volunteers and staff at the state and district levels. the ircs national headquarters has been in regular contact with its branch, monitoring the day-to-day development of the floods. the prime minister of india has declared the bihar floods a national calamity. he undertook an aerial survey of the affected areas and declared a relief package of inr 100 million (chf 2.5 million or usd 2.3 million), along with the release of 0.1 million tonnes of food grain for the state. he has given an assurance that a high-level committee will interact with the nepal government regarding control measures for the kosi flooding. the situation on 18 august 2008, a major breach (about 2 kilometres in length) occurred in the eastern embankment of the kosi river in kusha (indo-nepal border). more than 3.7 million litres of water was discharged through the breach, flooding hundreds of villages in the districts of northern bihar. government sources (national disaster management division) have indicated the following figures so far: no. of district affected 16 no. of villages affected 1,598 no. of people killed 47 no. of people affected 2.6 million no. of houses destroyed 227,969 the 16 affected districts include muzaffarpur, supaul, patna, katihar, nalanda, araria, west champaran, shekhpura, saharsa, purnea, saran, begusarai, bhagalpur, madhepura, vaishall and khagaria. due to this huge breach in its embankment, the kosi river has changed its course and is now flowing through areas that have not experienced major floods in the recent past. since the affected areas were traditionally not flood prone, people as well as the local administration were not adequately prepared to deal with the floods. in the affected districts, the road linkages as well as water and electricity supply are badly disrupted. railway tracks at several places have also been submerged. another major area of concern is that due to continued flow of water from the breached embankment, displaced people will not be able to go back to their original locations for at least another two or three months. as the water will not recede until the embankment is repaired, until then people will have to stay in relief camps being run by the government. most of the displaced population that is staying in the open does not have temporary shelter material and very few have plastic sheets. therefore, they have to make do with bed sheets and sarees (women's clothing item). the general hygiene conditions in the camps are very poor. as toilets in the camps are inadequate, people are resorting to open defecation. this poses a great health risk with water and vector borne diseases. a few cases of diarrhea have already been reported, which has the potential to increase given the scorching heat, unsafe water and poor environment conditions. the prime minister of india has declared the bihar floods a national calamity. he undertook an aerial survey of the affected areas and declared a relief package of inr 100 million (chf 2.5 million or usd 2.3 million), along with the release of 0.1 million tonnes of food grain for the state. he has given an assurance that a high-level
