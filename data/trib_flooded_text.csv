"Saurabh Malik Tribune News Service Chandigarh, October 28 Taking note of late filing of about 80 complaints alleging violation of the Insecticides Act, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has asserted that criminal negligence on part of Punjab Agriculture Department officials prima facie stood established. Justice Anil Kshetrapal also directed the forwarding of the order’s copy to the minister in-charge, the Chief Secretary and Director-General, Vigilance, “to look into the matter and take appropriate steps”. Justice Kshetrapal said the complaints were filed beyond the time prescribed and were likely to fail on that ground alone. “A very sad state of affairs in discharge of duties by the officials working in the Department of Agriculture, Punjab, has come to the notice of this court…. Prima facie criminal negligence, which adversely affects the society at large, is established on part of officials of the department of agriculture….” The assertion came in a case where complaint was not filed within the time prescribed under Section 468 of the CrPC.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Justice Kshetarpal observed it was unfortunate that the officials did not take timely action of lodging complaint as provided under the Insecticide Act and rules. The court was flooded with such petitions filed by manufacturers and dealers for quashing complaints on the ground that these were filed after the stipulated period. Justice Kshetarpal said various petitions had, in fact, been filed by accused manufacturers, distributors and dealers claiming these were filed beyond permissible time. Referring to an affidavit filed by the department secretary, Justice Kshetarpal added it was admitted that the complaints were filed beyond the period prescribed under Section 468 of the CrPC in 76 cases. Another affidavit was filed stating that a new standard procedure had been laid down and in future efforts would be made to ensure timely filing of such cases and their proper monitoring. The Department’s Principal Secretary assured the court that efforts would be made to ensure that “such mistakes are not be repeated” in future. Justice Kshetarpal added reading of the complaint made it apparent that the prosecution-complainant did not even attempt to seek extension of time. “In view of the aforesaid, this court is compelled to quash the criminal prosecution initiated being beyond the time prescribed. Hence, petition allowed,” Justice Kshetarpal asserted."

Besides, a few suspected dengue deaths were also reported in the nearby areas where various streets and plots often remain flooded with water due to defunct sewers. The area residents accused the Municipal Corporation, Ludhiana, for ignoring water accumulation on roads and vacant plots in ward 28 as the sewers remained defunct for the past more than one year. Munna Lal, Preeti’s father, said, “My daughter had fever, abdominal pain and other symptoms for the past five days. She was taking treatment from a private hospital, but her condition had deteriorated. She was later admitted to the DMCH where she succumbed to dengue on Friday.

"Kulwinder Sandhu Tribune News Service Moga, September 22 A farmer of Talwandi Bhangeria village in Moga district has saved at least 62 lakh litres of water in his paddy fields in just two months. A team of the Jal Shakti Abhiyan, led by PK Mishra, Director, Financial Intelligence Unit of the Union Government, has inspected the fields of progressive farmer Baldev Singh, who has adopted the technique of sowing paddy directly, thus saving water. As per the information, Baldev had sown paddy on 7 acres with direct sowing technique and on another 7 acres with the traditional method of flooding the fields, on experimental basis. He installed meters on the pumps irrigating the fields to calculate the usage.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Dr Jaswinder Singh Brar, Plant Protection Officer, who accompanied the team, said when they compared water usage after two months, the team found that the farmer had saved at least 62 lakh litres of water by using the new technique. The farmer told the visiting team that he was practicing the technique for the past couple of years and had saved water as well as power worth around Rs 1,100 per acre. Brar said the paddy fields with direct sowing method require irrigation once a week while those with traditional methods require irrigation two times a week. Many studies claim that directly seeding rice into fields than transplanting it into flooded fields also reduces methane emissions and slows down climate change, he added. Director PK Mishra commended the farmer for his exemplary work and appealed to farmers to do away with traditional technique and instead sow paddy directly to save maximum water, which is the need of the hour. Change technique to save power, water  Pertinently, 41.58 lakh hectares in Punjab is under cultivation. Of which, irrigation with the help of 14 lakh tubewells is done on 29.54 lakh hectares while canal water is used to irrigate just 11.16 lakh hectares If Baldev's claims are to be believed, Punjab could save Rs 770 crore on power by sowing paddy directly on 28 lakh hectares. These figures can be increased by bringing more area under canal irrigation and adopting rain harvesting practices The Central Groundwater Commission has already declared 116 of the total 138 revenue blocks in the state as “dark zones” for over exploitation of groundwater "
"Ruchika M Khanna Tribune News Service Chandigarh, September 19 Illegal sand mining, allegedly controlled by Akalis during 2008-14, and high prices of the basic construction material had led the people to reject the “Panthic” party in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Though this was a wake-up call and the then SAD-BJP government went into course correction by fixing cap on the prices of sand, they had shown the way on how to control this business of extracting and supplying sand and aggregate (mixture of sand and gravel). In 2017, immediately after the Congress stormed to power, party MLAs blatantly declared that now they would control the entire mining business. The alleged incident of former Irrigation and Power Minister Rana Gurjit Singh taking mines of sand and gravel in the names of his employees, was the first major controversy to hit the government. It ultimately forced Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh to accept Rana Gurjit’s resignation.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); This, however, did not deter the politicians, mainly from the ruling party, from taking control over the mining business. Political circles are abuzz with talk of certain ruling party MLAs being shareholders in the trade. With certain liquor contractors funding these politicians, the recent auction of blocks of quarries has seen a completely new breed of contractors taking over. Earlier, politicians and traditional mining contractors were involved in both legal and illegal mining of minor minerals. These contractors, at most places, have now been thrown out of the business, and politicians cutting across the political spectrum have taken over the trade. An internal report prepared by the Department of Mines (now merged with the Irrigation Department) for the Chief Minister had alleged that at least 30 MLAs of the ruling party were involved in mining business directly. Interestingly, the legal mining is taking place at only 16 quarries out of nearly 100 that have been auctioned by the state government in the last two years. The 52 quarries that were auctioned in May 2017, using progressive bidding technique, mining contractors could not deposit high quarterly installments for the amounts they bid for, and withdrew from the contracts on 36 quarries. This meant that the money that the cash-strapped state had to recover from auction of mines never materialised. Then, a stay was imposed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court on the auction of quarries as a cluster. This stay was vacated recently and the quarries were auctioned. But most of these have yet to get environmental clearance. Here lies the catch. The demand for sand and aggregate remains the same and the legal quarries are closed. But there is no shortage of material nor have the prices of sand and gravel gone up. Sand is available at Rs 3,000 per 100 cubic ft and bajri at Rs 2,600 to Rs 2,800 per 100 cubic ft. “Where is this coming from? Obviously, it’s the illegally mined minerals that are catering to the demand,” says Ropar-based RTI activist Darshan Singh Grewal. He says the one way to this is to bring sand under the GST net. Umpteen reports of how boat-like platforms that support the rig that pumps out water from illegally created mines, and have disturbed the topography of villages near Faridkot, have appeared. Till a few years ago, Faridkot was not known for having adequate minor minerals for extraction. Similarly, there have been reports of 40-ft-deep pits being dug on the banks of the Sutlej to extract the sand near Garhshankar. Capt Amarinder Singh, while flying towards Jalandhar in 2018, had himself expressed shock at the extent of mining he could see in Nawanshahr and Ropar. At other places, even the power transmission system has been threatened because of illegal mining around the poles. Birinder Singh Dhillon, Ropar district president of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee, told The Tribune that in spite of best efforts of the Congress government to control the menace, it had failed to yield results. “This is because of the strong nexus between mining department officials, contractors and some politicians. It is because of unauthorised and illegal mining that several areas in Ropar were flooded after a heavy downpour and discharge of water in the Sutlej last month. I have set up a committee of party workers to expose this nexus, and bring it to the notice of the Chief Minister,” he said. Though the common man is so far not affected by the high prices, the day is not far when the politician-mining contractor-official nexus could become an Achilles heel for the government. ________________________________________________ Where is the supply coming from? Legal mining is taking place at only 16 quarries of nearly 100 that have been auctioned by the state government in the last 2 years. Of 52 quarries that were auctioned in May 2017, contractors could not deposit quarterly instalments and withdrew from the contracts on 36 quarries. The demand for sand remains the same and legal quarries are closed. But there is no shortage of material nor have the prices of sand and gravel gone up.  Therefore, it is clear that illegally extracted sand and mining minerals are catering to the demand."
"Vishav Bharti & Aakanksha N Bhardwaj Chandigarh/ Jalandhar, September 16 The number of dengue cases in the state has crossed the 400 mark. Out of these, around 300 cases have been reported in the past one month only. But the next two and half months are crucial, more so this year as the rain fury has left many villages in the state inundated. According to the state’s Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme, the total number of cases have reached to around 450 this season. However, experts said Punjab’s pattern of dengue breakout reveals that over 90 per cent of the cases are reported between mid-September and November end. For the past four years, on an average, 14,000 cases are being reported and over 10,000 cases each year are reported in October and November. Punjab is one of the worst affected states in the country.

The victim has been identified as Manjit Kaur (30). A senior doctor said a survey was done to check the breeding of mosquitoes in the flood-affected areas earlier, but no disease-causing breed was found. “But now that a case has been reported, we will reinforce the team,” one of the officials from the Health Department said. Now, a survey will be done in the village and it will be checked if anyone else is suffering from dengue. “Dengue mosquito grows in stagnant water. Normally, this mosquito is found in clean water, but after this case, it is clear that dengue larvae are present in the flood water too,” an official said. On the precautions to be taken, SMO Dr AS Duggal said if anybody was suffering from fever for three-four days, they must visit their nearby medical camp. “We have been advising people living in flooded areas to spread the stagnant water and wear full sleeve clothes and use mosquito repellants. We will be looking at this problem on priority as we are suspecting more cases now,” he said."

"Anirudh Gupta Ferozepur, September 9 Following rise in the Sutlej level and subsequent flooding of areas along the border in this sector, Pakistan-based drug peddlers have been trying to push consignments inside the Indian territory through the “vulnerable” riverine gaps where fencing could not be erected. On Monday morning, the alert BSF troops of 136 Battalion thwarted the third consecutive attempt to smuggle heroin inside India through the Sutlej taking advantage of water hyacinth in the river. The BSF men seized five packets of heroin from an area near the Shameke border outpost, which was being pushed through the water channel. Since the Sutlej zigzags along the border in this sector, Pakistani smugglers try to exploit these riverine gaps to execute their sinister designs, said an official. However, special motor boat nakas have been set up, besides continuous patrolling is also being carried out to prevent any such infiltration and smuggling attempts. Two days ago, the BSF men had foiled another bid to smuggle 3 kg of heroin into the Indian side through the riverine gap in the Sutlej, which was stashed inside a rubber tube and concealed in water hyacinth to evade any suspicion. That consignment was also seized from the Shameke border outpost. In another similar attempt, 14 packets of heroin weighing 15.12-kg worth Rs 75 crore was seized from an Indian smuggler identified as Harjinder Singh, alias Jinder, of Palla Megha village two weeks ago.

"Vijay Mohan Tribune News Service Chandigarh, September 6 Twentytwo days after the floodgates of the Bhakra Dam were opened to discharge excess water following heavy rains, the Bhakra Beas Management Board is considering closing them as inflows into the reservoir have reduced. “The inflow into the Bhakra is about 36,000 cusecs, which is about the same as the outflow.

"Aparna Banerji Tribune News Service Jalandhar, August 26 Three days after a deluge hit the area, a 15-member delegation from Rame and Bamniyan villages in Lohian went to the Shahkot police station to complain about tippers and trailers picking up sand illegally from the bundh that protects their villages against Sutlej waters. They haven’t heard back from the police so far. Manjit Singh, who lives around 1 km away from the Meowal village bundh — the site of first breach in the district that caused the Sutlej to flood Phillaur — was among the villagers who held a dharna against illegal mining months ago. Villagers also wrote to the CM on the issue in March. They said there would have been no breach, had there been no sand mining. Residents of a number of villages situated along the Sutlej banks in the district have been complaining about illegal mining, but to no avail.

My house is very close to the bundh. We complained to the police on Friday, but there has been no response so far. Now, I have resigned myself to my fate. If mining goes on unchecked, a breach is certain.” On March 6, 2018, CM Amarinder Singh had tweeted: “Was on my way to Kartarpur when I saw some JCB machines evidently engaged in illegal mining on the Sutlej banks in Phillaur (Jalandhar) and Rahon (Nawanshahr).

"Ravi Dhaliwal Tribune News Service Gurdaspur, August 25 Suwidha centres across Punjab are witnessing an unprecedented rush of women following rumours that unorganised domestic workers will get a monthly grant from the Punjab Government if they get themselves registered under the Unorganised Workers’ Social Security Act.   Women flocking to these centres claimed they would be getting a monthly dole of Rs 2,000 once they submit their forms at centres. Keeping in view the magnitude of the problem, Gurdaspur DC Vipul Ujwal has called an urgent meeting of officials manning such centres and representatives of social organisations on Monday. Serpentine queues can be seen at Gurdaspur, Batala, Pathankot, Dhariwal, Pathankot, Sujanpur, Bhoa, Qadian, Dera Baba Nanak, Fatehgarh Churian and Naushera Majha Singh even as reports from other cities of Punjab speak of a similar rush.

"Saurabh Malik Tribune News Service Chandigarh, October 28 Taking note of late filing of about 80 complaints alleging violation of the Insecticides Act, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has asserted that criminal negligence on part of Punjab Agriculture Department officials prima facie stood established. Justice Anil Kshetrapal also directed the forwarding of the order’s copy to the minister in-charge, the Chief Secretary and Director-General, Vigilance, “to look into the matter and take appropriate steps”.

"Kulwinder Sandhu Tribune News Service Moga, September 22 A farmer of Talwandi Bhangeria village in Moga district has saved at least 62 lakh litres of water in his paddy fields in just two months. A team of the Jal Shakti Abhiyan, led by PK Mishra, Director, Financial Intelligence Unit of the Union Government, has inspected the fields of progressive farmer Baldev Singh, who has adopted the technique of sowing paddy directly, thus saving water. As per the information, Baldev had sown paddy on 7 acres with direct sowing technique and on another 7 acres with the traditional method of flooding the fields, on experimental basis. He installed meters on the pumps irrigating the fields to calculate the usage.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Dr Jaswinder Singh Brar, Plant Protection Officer, who accompanied the team, said when they compared water usage after two months, the team found that the farmer had saved at least 62 lakh litres of water by using the new technique. The farmer told the visiting team that he was practicing the technique for the past couple of years and had saved water as well as power worth around Rs 1,100 per acre. Brar said the paddy fields with direct sowing method require irrigation once a week while those with traditional methods require irrigation two times a week. Many studies claim that directly seeding rice into fields than transplanting it into flooded fields also reduces methane emissions and slows down climate change, he added. Director PK Mishra commended the farmer for his exemplary work and appealed to farmers to do away with traditional technique and instead sow paddy directly to save maximum water, which is the need of the hour. Change technique to save power, water  Pertinently, 41.58 lakh hectares in Punjab is under cultivation. Of which, irrigation with the help of 14 lakh tubewells is done on 29.54 lakh hectares while canal water is used to irrigate just 11.16 lakh hectares If Baldev's claims are to be believed, Punjab could save Rs 770 crore on power by sowing paddy directly on 28 lakh hectares. These figures can be increased by bringing more area under canal irrigation and adopting rain harvesting practices The Central Groundwater Commission has already declared 116 of the total 138 revenue blocks in the state as “dark zones” for over exploitation of groundwater "
"Ruchika M Khanna Tribune News Service Chandigarh, September 19 Illegal sand mining, allegedly controlled by Akalis during 2008-14, and high prices of the basic construction material had led the people to reject the “Panthic” party in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Though this was a wake-up call and the then SAD-BJP government went into course correction by fixing cap on the prices of sand, they had shown the way on how to control this business of extracting and supplying sand and aggregate (mixture of sand and gravel). In 2017, immediately after the Congress stormed to power, party MLAs blatantly declared that now they would control the entire mining business. The alleged incident of former Irrigation and Power Minister Rana Gurjit Singh taking mines of sand and gravel in the names of his employees, was the first major controversy to hit the government. It ultimately forced Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh to accept Rana Gurjit’s resignation.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); This, however, did not deter the politicians, mainly from the ruling party, from taking control over the mining business. Political circles are abuzz with talk of certain ruling party MLAs being shareholders in the trade. With certain liquor contractors funding these politicians, the recent auction of blocks of quarries has seen a completely new breed of contractors taking over. Earlier, politicians and traditional mining contractors were involved in both legal and illegal mining of minor minerals. These contractors, at most places, have now been thrown out of the business, and politicians cutting across the political spectrum have taken over the trade. An internal report prepared by the Department of Mines (now merged with the Irrigation Department) for the Chief Minister had alleged that at least 30 MLAs of the ruling party were involved in mining business directly. Interestingly, the legal mining is taking place at only 16 quarries out of nearly 100 that have been auctioned by the state government in the last two years. The 52 quarries that were auctioned in May 2017, using progressive bidding technique, mining contractors could not deposit high quarterly installments for the amounts they bid for, and withdrew from the contracts on 36 quarries. This meant that the money that the cash-strapped state had to recover from auction of mines never materialised. Then, a stay was imposed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court on the auction of quarries as a cluster. This stay was vacated recently and the quarries were auctioned. But most of these have yet to get environmental clearance. Here lies the catch. The demand for sand and aggregate remains the same and the legal quarries are closed. But there is no shortage of material nor have the prices of sand and gravel gone up. Sand is available at Rs 3,000 per 100 cubic ft and bajri at Rs 2,600 to Rs 2,800 per 100 cubic ft. “Where is this coming from? Obviously, it’s the illegally mined minerals that are catering to the demand,” says Ropar-based RTI activist Darshan Singh Grewal. He says the one way to this is to bring sand under the GST net. Umpteen reports of how boat-like platforms that support the rig that pumps out water from illegally created mines, and have disturbed the topography of villages near Faridkot, have appeared. Till a few years ago, Faridkot was not known for having adequate minor minerals for extraction. Similarly, there have been reports of 40-ft-deep pits being dug on the banks of the Sutlej to extract the sand near Garhshankar. Capt Amarinder Singh, while flying towards Jalandhar in 2018, had himself expressed shock at the extent of mining he could see in Nawanshahr and Ropar. At other places, even the power transmission system has been threatened because of illegal mining around the poles. Birinder Singh Dhillon, Ropar district president of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee, told The Tribune that in spite of best efforts of the Congress government to control the menace, it had failed to yield results. “This is because of the strong nexus between mining department officials, contractors and some politicians. It is because of unauthorised and illegal mining that several areas in Ropar were flooded after a heavy downpour and discharge of water in the Sutlej last month. I have set up a committee of party workers to expose this nexus, and bring it to the notice of the Chief Minister,” he said. Though the common man is so far not affected by the high prices, the day is not far when the politician-mining contractor-official nexus could become an Achilles heel for the government. ________________________________________________ Where is the supply coming from? Legal mining is taking place at only 16 quarries of nearly 100 that have been auctioned by the state government in the last 2 years. Of 52 quarries that were auctioned in May 2017, contractors could not deposit quarterly instalments and withdrew from the contracts on 36 quarries. The demand for sand remains the same and legal quarries are closed.

Normally, this mosquito is found in clean water, but after this case, it is clear that dengue larvae are present in the flood water too,” an official said. On the precautions to be taken, SMO Dr AS Duggal said if anybody was suffering from fever for three-four days, they must visit their nearby medical camp. “We have been advising people living in flooded areas to spread the stagnant water and wear full sleeve clothes and use mosquito repellants. We will be looking at this problem on priority as we are suspecting more cases now,” he said."

"Anirudh Gupta Ferozepur, September 9 Following rise in the Sutlej level and subsequent flooding of areas along the border in this sector, Pakistan-based drug peddlers have been trying to push consignments inside the Indian territory through the “vulnerable” riverine gaps where fencing could not be erected. On Monday morning, the alert BSF troops of 136 Battalion thwarted the third consecutive attempt to smuggle heroin inside India through the Sutlej taking advantage of water hyacinth in the river. The BSF men seized five packets of heroin from an area near the Shameke border outpost, which was being pushed through the water channel. Since the Sutlej zigzags along the border in this sector, Pakistani smugglers try to exploit these riverine gaps to execute their sinister designs, said an official.

"Deepkamal Kaur Tribune News Service Jalandhar, August 28 Over the years, crores have been spent on irrigation and flood control on the 1,400-km dhussi bundh in the state. Around Rs 22.66 crore has been sanctioned for this fiscal too. But after witnessing last week’s flood havoc across Jalandhar alone, it now seems that either the funds were less or these were improperly utilised as the Sutlej banks unexpectedly gave way at 18 points, leading to the worst-ever disaster. As many as 21 villages remained flooded in Phillaur and Shahkot subdivisions for nearly a week with huge losses incurred by all departments, including the PSPCL, Railways, School Education and Agriculture. Even though the final estimates for the repair work of the bundhs are yet to be prepared but it is learnt that all big and small breaches would require at least Rs 10 crore. Though the villagers have been venting their ire against the Drainage Department for their alleged laxity, the officials are not ready to accept any fault at their end.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); “What could have we done when nearly 2.75 lakh cusecs of water came flowing from the Bhakra and its tributaries in one go? Our bundhs have been designed only to bear water up to the capacity of 2 lakh cusecs. Water at some places was flowing over the berms. Had the bundhs not been strong enough, there could have been 500-600 breaches going by the amount of water that suddenly flowed in,” said Chief Engineer, Drainage, Sanjiv Gupta. A junior engineer said, “The Jalandhar circle that includes embankments falling in five districts (Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Nawanshahr, Ludhiana and Hoshiarpur) got only Rs 4-5 lakh. The most affected Lohian-Shahkot area, which falls in the 45-km section, got just Rs 30 lakh. This amount gets used up in cleaning just 15 km of drains.” Talking about the reasons for Lohian villages bearing the maximum brunt, drainage officials said, “This area forms a deadlock with gates at Harike lying shut. There was no way for water to go beyond. So, the water got collected here, which just kept on spreading, flooding more villages each day.” DC Varinder Kumar Sharma said, “I do not want to get into the debate on the working of the Drainage Department. I am more concerned about getting all breaches plugged. All breaches in Phillaur have been filled. We’ve got access to four-five breaches in Lohian beyond Janian Chahal village. We have taken permission to carry sandbags across the Gidderpindi track between 7 am and 7 pm.”"

"Ruchika M Khanna Tribune News Service Chandigarh, August 21 Even as the state remained on the edge, with almost 75,000 cusecs water being released by the BBMB, the government is grappling with the issue of compensating farmers, who have suffered losses worth crores. The government has been dilly-dallying on formulating a crop insurance policy, which could have been useful to compensate farmers whose losses are now estimated at Rs 750 crore. In such a situation, the relief that the state can offer is just Rs 12,200 per hectare (or Rs 5,083.33 per acre) from the State Disaster Relief Management Fund, unless the Centre recognises flooding in Punjab as a natural disaster and gives it a flood relief package.  It is only then the cash-strapped state can look at a more decent compensation to be awarded to farmers. At places, where the farmers have suffered a loss of more than one crop (in Fazilka- Abohar, where besides horticulture crops, cotton is grown), Rs 5,625 per acre would be given for loss of horticulture crops and Rs 5,083.33 per acre for other crops sown along with kinnows. Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh today wrote to the Prime Minister, seeking a Rs 1,000-crore special package, besides asking him to instruct the authorities to waive crop loans taken by farmers in affected villages for the current cropping season. The flooding in the Sutlej due to discharge of water from Bhakra Dam has caused extensive damage to crops, inundating 326 villages of Ropar, Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Moga, Ferozepur and Kapurthala. It is estimated that crop on 1.20 lakh acres of cultivated area is submerged.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Official sources, however, say that it would not be easy to get relief from the Centre, considering that the state decided against adopting the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. Punjab had opted out of PMFBY in 2016 (when the Akali-BJP was in power). Three years on, the state government is still considering on whether to come up with a crop insurance scheme or set up a crop compensation fund. Interestingly, Punjab Farmers and Farm Workers Commission had recommended that an insurance corporation be set up to compensate farmers for crop loss. They had recommended that farmers pay a levy of Re 1 per bag, with a matching levy to be paid by the state to create a corpus of Rs 250 crore each year (considering 2.50 crore bags of wheat and paddy reach mandis each year). The sources agree that on an average, Punjab has had to release Rs 100-150 crore crop damage compensation to farmers each year for the past seven years. In 2015, because of the whitefly attack on cotton, crop worth Rs 650 crore was damaged. Last year, too, Rs 100 crore was released for fields in Majha region getting submerged. “The only way to go forward would be to have a crop insurance scheme or a corpus to compensate farmers in case of loss of crop. A decision in favour of either of these options will have to be taken soon,” said a officer.

"Rajmeet Singh Tribune News Service Chandigarh, July 21 The state government has blamed Haryana for the damage caused in Patiala and Sangrur districts due to the overflowing Ghaggar. The state has pointed out that timely channelisation of the 17.5-km stretch from Makror Sahib to Karail by the Punjab’s Drainage Department could have saved marooning of several areas along Ghaggar’s embankments, but Haryana did not allow it. Sensing gravity of the situation and loss suffered by farmers, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh has decided to take up the issue with the Centre. “The misery of the people due to flooding needs to be addressed at the earliest, rising above political differences on water sharing,” said a senior official in the CMO.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The state’s Drainage Department has requested the Central Water Commission (CWC) to depute its officials to visit the affected areas to get first-hand information on the necessity to undertake the pending channelisation work. Chief Engineer (Drainage) Sanjeev Gupta said, “I have requested the CWC to visit the flooded areas. This would allow us to explain the need to carry out channelisation as per the recommendations of the study conducted by Irrigation and Power Institute, Amritsar.” The state has sought strengthening of the embankments raised by villagers from Makror Sahib to Karail. The damage to villages due to swollen Ghaggar has once again brought to the fore the tussle between Punjab and Haryana over water sharing. While Haryana wants release of water in the Hansi-Butana canal, it is notletting the Punjab Government channelise the Ghaggar near Khanauri on the interstate border. The river had caused huge damage in Patiala, Sangrur and Mansa districts in 1988, 2010 and 2015. This year too, the river has been in spate due to incessant rains, creating havoc in numerous villages. What is neighbouring state’s objection?  The work of constructing 22.45-km embankments on both sides of the river was completed in 2009 under phase-1 of channelisation from Khanauri to Makror Sahib.  Haryana raised objection before the Central Water Commission (CWC) over the phase 2 from Khanauri to Karail, stating that further channelisation will endanger its villages. After villagers of Moonak belt filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court seeing continuation of the work, the matter was referred to the CWC.  After six years, the CWC conducted a meeting of the Ghaggar standing committee in March and directed to carry out a model study of Ghaggar basin by an independent agency to settle the dispute.

"Kulwinder Sandhu Tribune News Service Moga, July 14 Pushing for sustainable agriculture practices, the Union Government is carrying out a study with the help of the state Agriculture Department in Moga and its adjoining districts to substantiate the worth of directly sowing paddy without puddling the fields. Various studies conducted across the world, particularly in the South-Asian countries, claim that direct sowing of paddy without puddling the fields reduce methane gas emission, preserve groundwater and save power. Though a debate is on in Punjab for many years to reduce paddy cultivation due to depleting groundwater, air pollution due to stubble burning and huge consumption of power, farmers are unwilling to switch to other crops. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });The study by the new Union Ministry of Jal Shakti is aimed at preserving the natural resources and save Punjab from turning into a “desert”. A team of Jal Shakti headed by its Deputy Secretary VK Paul visited Talwandi Bhangerian village in Moga and inspected the fields of progressive farmer Baldev Singh who had directly sown paddy. He has sown paddy on seven acres with this technique and seven acres with the traditional practice of flooding the fields with water. The visiting team in association with the state Agriculture Department has installed meters on water pumps irrigating both paddy fields for comparative study on water consumed. The Central team will also monitor the power consumed in both fields. The farmer told the visiting team that he was practicing the new technique for the past couple of years and has found that he saved around Rs 1,100 per acre on power consumption, which comes out to Rs 2,750 per hectare. Jaswinder Singh Brar, Plant Protection Officer of Moga district, who accompanied the Central team, said 41.58 lakh hectares in Punjab was under cultivation of various crops. Of which, irrigation with the help of 14-lakh tubewells was done on 29.54 lakh hectares while canal water was used on just 11.16 lakh hectares. “Going by the claims of this Moga farmer, Punjab could save Rs 770 crore on powerpower by directly sowing paddy on 28 lakh hectares. These figures can be increased by bringing more area under canal irrigation and adopting rain harvesting practices,” said Dinesh Dhawan, Deputy Adviser of Niti Aayog, who also accompanied the team. It acquires significance because the Central Groundwater Commission has already declared 116 of the total 138 revenue blocks in the state as “dark zones” for over exploitation of groundwater. The paddy fields with direct sowing method requires irrigation once a week as compared to two irrigation in the traditional method of transplanting the seedlings. As such, 50 per cent of water could be saved by adopting this new technique, which is the need of the hour. Brar says many studies claim that directly seeding rice into fields than transplanting it into flooded fields reduces methane emissions and slow down climate change. "

"Ravi Dhaliwal Tribune News Service Gurdaspur, July 4 The Pakistan government’s insistence on constructing a causeway, instead of a bridge, on its side as a part of the Kartarpur corridor project may indefinitely push back the October 31 deadline to complete the project. The Pakistan government wants to build a 300-m-long causeway over a low-lying area till the border which, in turn, will join the 100-m-long bridge being constructed by India. Officials of the NHAI and Ceigall India Limited, the company contracted to build the corridor, have objected to Pakistan’s proposal saying huge part of the corridor in the Indian territory may see heavy flooding of the Ravi, if a causeway was built. A causeway refers to a roadway which does not allow nautical navigation underneath it while a bridge does. Jeetendra Singh, vice president of the firm, said there was every possibility that flood water would be diverted to the Indian side if a causeway was built.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); “We are at a lower gradient with respect to the Ravi floodplains in Pakistan. So when the Ravi is in spate, the water will flow towards us. A bridge will mean the water will drain out, while a causeway will not allow the drainage. We had told Pakistani officials right at the start that we need to build a bridge adhering to international norms. We have flagged our concerns multiple times, but they have been saying they can only make a causeway. That is not going to work,” he said. The issue is likely to resonate in the technical committee meeting to be held at Wagah border on July 16. An official said Pakistan’s resolve to establish a causeway stems from the fact that the structure could be easily dismantled in the event of an eventuality. “If something drastic happens and the corridor becomes inoperative in future, the causeway can be brought down easily. The very purpose of the corridor stands defeated if it gets flooded,” said the official. Cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, who is supervising the operations in his capacity as Dera Baba Nanak MLA, said he was optimistic that the July 16 meeting would offer a solution. “It is a race against time. I hope technical officials will come up with a viable solution which is suitable to both sides,” he said.  Temple issue resolved   The management committee of the temple, which comes in the right of way of the corridor, held a meeting with Dera Baba Nanak SDM Gursimran Singh and NHAI officials. Since the NHAI has already acquired the outer wall of the temple, officials told the committee members that a new wall would be built which would not come in the way before the acquired wall was demolished. The SDM said proper rituals would be followed when the wall is dismantled. "

Several labourers, accompanied by nearly 50 policemen, covered the structure. The road will now be constructed over it. Earlier, Ceigal India Limited, a Ludhiana-based private company hired by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to complete the project, which hit a roadblock after a dargah and a temple were spotted in the designated ROW. It is mandatory to construct the corridor within the limits of ROW.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Jeetendra Singh, vice-president, Ceigal India Limited, said: “The work was stopped on around 100-m stretch. We took the decision only after we found that the structure was fabricated by the caretaker. The original dargah does not actually fall within the designated ROW and land records proved that the one recently constructed was a sham.” Cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa said the corridor by all means would be complete by October 31. Meanwhile, the temple issue remained unresolved. Sources said the temple’s management committee was based in New Delhi and its members would be arriving soon to discuss the vexed issue with officials. “The land on which the temple is built has already been acquired. However, we will have to discuss the issue with the committee members before we take any action,” Jeetendra said. An official said if the committee members do not come up with a positive response, a part of the temple, including its outer wall and a room, would be demolished. “This may create problems. That is why we are insisting on a plan that will benefit all stakeholders,” the official added. No dialogue on causeway There has been no headway in talks pertaining to the contentious issue of Pakistan building a causeway in its territory. The NHAI wants to build a bridge instead of the causeway. An official said: “If a causeway is constructed there are chances of it being flooded, defeating the very purpose of the corridor. If we can build a bridge on the Indian side, what is stopping the Pakistan government from doing so on in their territory? If there is a bridge, there will be no flooding at all.”"

"Arun Sharma Tribune News Service Ropar, June 11 Tanda village in Ropar block is hardly 35 km from the state capital, but has no road connectivity. The 2-km dirt track that connects the village with the Purkhali-Bardar road remains inundated during the monsoon, leaving this sub-mountainous area inaccessible as two choes fall on the section. Residents say their pleas to politicians as well as officials over the decades have failed to yield result. So much so that they have now stopped making efforts to get a metalled road constructed. Ram Ratan, a farmer, says there is no land reserved for the road to connect the village with the main road. The dirt track passes through private land with multiple owners from Tanda and nearby Bardar village. A large portion is also owned by outsiders.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); “Our living conditions get challenging during monsoon,” he says. As the village is surrounded by hillocks, rainwater accumulates in the fields and the flooded choes virtually block the route for vehicular traffic, he says. Former sarpanch Karnail Singh says he visited officials and politicians over 10 years, but to no avail. When choes are flooded during the monsoon, villagers use ropes to help students cross over, he says. During medical exigency, the family has to get medicines as it is difficult to move the patient out. Karnail says residents have already donated their land for the road and land owners from Bardar village too have agreed to swap their land in the area, yet the government continues to dither. Public Works Department XEN Vishal Gupta said the survey of area was conducted a few years ago. For laying a metalled road, the villagers were supposed to transfer the land to the Rural Development and Panchayats Department, which was to further given to the PWD, he said. The panchayat department is yet to complete the formalities of swapping the land of Bardar residents with that of Tanda panchayat land."

The counsel was also asked to specify the factors that weighed with the government while taking such “a sweeping decision”. In response to the queries, the state counsel submitted that she required a week’s time to seek instructions from the state Chief Secretary and apprise the court. The case will now come up for further hearing in first week of April. The HC has already made it clear that granting extension in service to an employee after the age of superannuation was the employer’s prerogative. An employee could be granted extension in service for a year, but denied the same for second year."

"Shubhadeep Choudhury  Tribune News Service  Kolkata, January 31  The trauma of Partition, reflected in the writings of Amrita Pritam, was narrated to participants at a national seminar in Calcutta University today.  Amrita Pritam, who was born on August 31, 1919, at Gujranwala, Pakistan, was 28-year-old when the country was divided. She went through the horror and felt the pain of people. According to Chaman Lal, former Punjabi University (Patiala) professor, who later joined the JNU, Amrita’s   finest expressions came through when Partition formed the backdrop of her works. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });The setting could not have been more appropriate for a presentation of this sort. It reignited memories of the Great Calcutta Killings of 1946 and the sufferings of millions of refugees, who flooded the city in the aftermath of Partition. Amrita’s widely read poem “Aaj Akhan Shah Nu” was written in the backdrop of Partition violence. Chaman Lal chose to speak about the poem.  The poem is in a rhythmical form. The effect of words is most intense when the poem is sung as a song. “Pakistani band “Mekaal Hasan Band” has recorded the song in an album,” he said. Next the professor cited “Pinjar”, a novelette by Amrita, which too has Partition violence as the main theme.  Chaman Lal concluded his presentation, saying, “Amrita’s story of Partition, its horror and tragedy have communal men as the tormentors and women as the sufferers. The novel “Pinjar” focuses more on the trauma of women abducted, raped, murdered, stripped and paraded naked in the streets, forcefully married or made slaves by the opponent communalised community.” Besides Amrita, papers are also being read in the seminar on Urdu poet Kaifi Azmi and Bengali poet Subhash Mukhopadhyay. This year is the birth centenary year of these two poets too.    "

Studies would suffer in schools as they had to prepare for teaching students the next day, but would not get enough time for preparation. The Deputy Commissioners in various districts of Punjab, who are the District Electoral Officers, are dealing with hundreds of such applications. With applications in hand, employees are queuing up outside offices to somehow escape the poll duty.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Sample this: Pain in heart, birthday of daughter, a sick relative, skin allergy, taking care of an infant, cooking for parents, attending to a pregnant wife.

Everyone wants exemption from election work,” an IAS officer said. An official in Patiala wants to keep away from the polling duty, citing pain in the heart, which is yet to be detected by doctors, while another wants to look after his visiting relatives from abroad. In Ludhiana, an official wants to help his ailing father in taking care of his fields, while another wants to attend to his pregnant wife. And to ensure that applications are not turned down, officials are exploiting their “connections” in the police, political circles and even in the bureaucracy.

"Nitin Jain & Akash Ghai Tribune News Service Chandigarh, July 27 “Since the private developer had earned almost Rs 1 crore after spending over Rs 25 crore on the project, there seems to be no scope of the firm director paying crores of rupees (as corruption money) after earning such a meagre profit.” This is how the Vigilance Bureau (VB) had concluded the fresh investigation to give the clean chit to Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh and 17 others in the criminal and corruption case registered on the recommendation of the Vidhan Sabha, alleging a scam in granting exemption for transferring 32.1 acres of prime land of Amritsar Improvement Trust (AIT) to a private developer. In the cancellation report filed in October 2016 before a special court in Mohali, which had been holding the trial for the past 10 years, the Vigilance Bureau had trashed all charges levelled against the accused and sought their discharge. The report was accepted on Friday.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The 21-page investigation report was submitted by Jalandhar Range Deputy Inspector General Rajinder Singh, who is attached to the VB and headed a SIT formed to probe the case afresh on the directions of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, issued on December 22, 2014. It calculated the entire costing and earning of Veer Coloniser and Builders Private Limited, Amritsar, in purchasing, developing and selling 32.1 acres of ‘controversial’ land exempted from acquisition. The VB investigation found that the private developer spent Rs 25.5 crore and earned Rs 26.5 crore in the entire scheme. Trashing the charge of causing Rs 60-crore loss to the AIT through the development of Veer Enclave, the VB observed that the private developer not only benefitted the farmers, whose land it purchased at a higher rate than offered by the AIT, but also helped the public, whom it sold residential and commercial sites at a lesser price than that offered by AIT. The VB probe further opined that Veer Enclave also caused no harm to the adjoining 188 acres, on which the AIT had planned a separate development project. “This private colony has complied with all internal and external development norms, which could prove no hindrance to the development of adjoining 188 acres by the AIT,” observed the Vigilance Bureau investigation. The VB reported that the charges of tampering with Vidhan Sabha and AIT records, misuse of power and causing loss to the state exchequer in the exemption of land from acquisition could not be proved. The bureau also quoted the state government’s statement given before the High Court, “The government has the absolute and unfettered power under Section 56 of the Act to exempt any area out of the scheme area. As such, the government, considering all pros and cons, had deemed it necessary to exempt an area measuring 32.1 acres out of the total scheme area measuring 188 acres.”  WHAT SC RULED IN 2010 The VB quoted a Supreme Court ruling, dated April 26, 2010, wherein the expulsion of Capt Amarinder Singh from the Vidhan Sabha was declared constitutionally invalid. The ruling said: “... the allegedly improper exemption of land took place during the 12th term of the Punjab Vidhan Sabha, whereas the constitution of the Special Committee to inquire into the same took place during the 13th term. It was not proper for the Assembly to inquire into actions that took place during its previous term, especially when there was no relatable business that had lapsed from the previous term. If we were to permit the legislature to exercise privileges for acting against members for their executive acts during previous terms, the courts are likely to be flooded with cases involving political rivalries. One can conceive that whenever there is a change of regime, the fresh incumbents would readily fall back on the device of legislative privileges to expel their political opponents as well as dissidents...” "

The rain added to the miseries of the farmers who were yet to harvest their crop and also those who had brought their crop to the grain markets on Wednesday morning. State marketing board officials said 2 lakh MT of wheat in gunny bags were yet to be lifted from grain markets. “The expected arrival of wheat in Moga district is 9.23 lakh MT,” claimed Jaswinder Singh Brar, an agro-scientist.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); District Magistrate Dilraj Singh Sandhawalia claimed that 7,19,054 MT of wheat had been procured by agencies out of the total of 7,19,187 MT arrived in the grain markets till Tuesday evening. He added that 91.54 per cent of the total payment for the purchased wheat had been released to farmers. He claimed that since 99.9 per cent of wheat brought to the Moga grain markets till Tuesday evening was purchased by the government agencies, farmers need not worry about the inclement weather. The procurement process is likely to resume only after the sun shines bright to dry the wet grains. The agencies are not accepting grains with higher moisture content. Agriculture officials claimed that the quality of grains was likely to affect only in wheat bags submerged in low-lying areas of the grain markets. “Wheat grains have the tendency to lose the humidity content quickly in bright sunshine,” said Brar.

"CHANDIGARH: Supporters of newly inducted Cabinet ministers flooded their offices with bouquets and sweets.

Local Vigilance officials, who are preparing for his retirement party, too are confused about his possible extension. Bhagtana’s service was extended by two years in the past. A President’s medal winner, Bhagtana was promoted as PPS officer in 2005. He started his career as Assistant Sub-Inspector in 1998. Bhagtana said it was up to the state government to grant him extension. He had moved an application with the Punjab VB chief director seeking extension of his services, which was accepted, but the final nod from the government is still awaited. Bhagtana is considered close to leaders in the ruling party. He had served as SHO at Lambi and DSP at Gidderbaha in the past.  Anything to please mantri Ferozepur: In a show of “one-upmanship”, elated supporters tried their level best to prove their edge over compatriots to express their “gaiety” over induction of Guruharsahai MLA Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi into the state Cabinet on his arrival here after he assumed the charge of Sports and Youth Welfare Minister. From burning crackers to showering flowers, distribution of soft drinks and ladoos, supporters created a festive environment for his reception. However, one of the supporters went a step ahead to impress the minister by arranging a “langar” of imported beer cans. A local women’s college released hundreds of balloons carrying Sodhi’s picture to mark his first visit to the border district. The pomp and show that marked his arrival here did not augur well with some senior Congressmen who preferred to abstain from the event.  ‘Forgetful’ Malik blames Jakhar for ‘mess’(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Abohar: At the maiden rally of state BJP chief Shwait Malik, the Rajya Sabha MP targeted the Jakhar family for doing nothing during their 46-year-long representation in the Vidhan Sabha.

Neighbours, other party MLAs and MPs got to know about the marriage from his Facebook post, following which he was flooded with congratulatory calls. A day after marriage, Dhaula was back to business, conducting meetings and calling officers for the pending works of party workers. All members of the bride and groom families partook of langar in a Faridkot gurdwara after marriage. “I am against expenditure on marriage and it’s another effort to set an example for others. Marriage does not mean to fire weapons or consume liquor , but it’s a start of new life for a couple with the blessings of God.

The vehicles belonged to his relatives. “I saw some vehicles leaving his house in the morning. I thought he is leaving for a political function as usually many people in vehicles come to meet him daily,” said Surinder Singh, an area resident. Harpreet Singh Khalsa, who has been with Dhaula since 2010 and is also a matchmaker, said Dhaula wanted to take only 15 relatives for marriage, but he convinced him to take along at least seven main members of their Unemployed Linemen Union, Punjab. “Hope better sense prevails upon others also and Punjab could see decline in lavish marriages in near future,” said Khalsa. Punjab AAP co-convener and Sunam MLA Aman Arora said his party was proud of Dhaula and the state needed such marriages to reduce expenses. “Dhaula has set an example for others to follow. AAP has always believed in simple living,” he said. "
"Chandigarh: The Punjab Congress’ election manifesto clearly mentions that “the use of helicopter for travelling by the Chief Minister and the ministers will be forbidden except in case of emergency or calamity.” However, the party MLA from Guruharsahai, Rana Gurmeet Singh Sodhi, was recently seen using a chopper en route to Ferozepur. One of his enthusiastic supporters filmed the landing and shared it on social media. Interestingly, Sodhi had played the role of a CM in the 2015 Punjabi movie, ‘Born To Be King’. He is considered to be a strong contender for a Cabinet berth, as and when the expansion takes place. Teen orator in Akali camp  Muktsar: Abhay Singh Dhillon (16), a Class XII student at Welham Boys’ School, Dehradun, is making his presence felt as an orator in Punjabi and English. During the Assembly polls last year, he campaigned for his uncle, SAD candidate from Gidderbaha Hardeep Singh ‘Dimpy’ Dhillon. He is much-sought-after by Akali workers of the area. Recently, when SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal came to meet party workers in Gidderbaha, the Akali leadership gave time to Abhay, who had come home during the winter vacation, to address the gathering. Abhay, who has played squash at the national level, is also the chairman of the “Security Council” of Welham’s Model United Nations Committee and has bagged national and international awards. Piety a priority for Badal Muktsar: Former Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal rarely skips any religious ceremony in his native village. Recently, when a Nagar Kirtan was taken out at Badal village, the SAD patron came out of his mansion to welcome the Sangat. He also performed ‘sewa’ by organising langar. His personal staff was seen serving langar to the people. Out of power after serving as the CM for two terms in a row, Badal is known for starting his election campaign by paying obeisance at all religious places in the village.

Manoj then had to delete all posts on his FB account by his friends and “followers”. SAD or Cong, officers hold fort Fazilka: Top civil and police officers in the district have managed to hold on to their posts despite the change of guard in the state. Deputy Commissioner Isha Kalia, who assumed charge on February 2, 2016, and SSP Ketan Baliram Patil, who took over on January 7, 2017, are still at the helm, even as most of the officers across the state have been reshuffled. The district boasts of two political bigwigs — SAD chief and former Deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal is the MLA from Jalalabad, while PPCC president Sunil Jakhar is an Abohar native and a former MLA, even though he now represents Gurdaspur in the Lok Sabha. Both apparently call the shots in the district administration. Some officers, it seems, have mastered the art of remaining in the politicians’ good books, irrespective of party affiliations.

"Saurabh Malik Tribune News Service Chandigarh, December 6 Taking cognisance of petitions by firms, societies and individuals flooding the courts for release of dues, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has asked the Advocate-General to explain whether Punjab was facing a “deep financial crunch”. Justice Rajan Gupta’s Bench also set six-week deadline for Advocate-General Atul Nanda to come out with his response on the issue after holding a meeting with the Finance Department officers. The development took place on a petition filed by “The Shajrana Coop L&C Society Ltd” against Punjab and other respondents. As the petition on release of payment for work done under government came up for resumed hearing, Nanda was present in the court.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Justice Gupta asserted that the High Court in the recent past had been flooded with cases where firms, societies and individuals sought directions for release of dues for discharge of liabilities admitted on completion of contractual work. Several such petitions were disposed of with a direction to the authorities concerned to consider the claim before passing a speaking order and release payment if found due. In certain cases, the payment was, indeed, found to be due. Yet, it was not released. Justice Gupta added: “As a result, a number of contempt petitions have emanated and listed before this Bench today. Hundreds of such cases have been disposed of in the recent months.” During the course of hearing, Justice Gupta put a query to Nanda whether the state was confronted with a grave fiscal crisis. Responding to the query, Nanda submitted that he needed sometime to examine the issue after holding a meeting with the Finance Department officers. He also assured the Bench that a policy would be framed “to obviate the necessity of citizens rushing to the court for trivial issue of payment of amounts due as admitted liability”. Taking a note of the assertions, Justice Gupta gave Nanda time till fourth week of January to do the needful. This is, perhaps, the first time the Punjab and Haryana High Court has posed such a query to the state government, though different High Courts across the country have in their orders referred to imposition of Article 360, where the President is satisfied that a situation of financial instability has arisen in a state or the country. The Article makes it clear that salaries and allowances of an employee serving the state can also be reduced.

"Tribune News Service Jalandhar, December 4 Punjab’s much-publicised ban on use of polythene bags seems to have vanished in thin air due to the lax approach of the state authorities. Traders in Delhi and Gujarat have started smuggling more than 350 tonnes of plastic bags (10-15 microns) into the state every month. Punjab had clamped a ban on the use of plastic bags in urban areas from April 1, 2016. The state government had also made it clear that there will be no production, purchase, distribution, selling, recycling and use of plastic bags in all nagar panchayats, municipal councils and municipal corporations of the state. Though initially challans were issued to violators of the ban, but now hardly any government official is taking any action against the violators. “Punjab markets have been flooded with more than 350 tonnes of thin plastic bags by certain traders, who bring it at cheap rates from Delhi and Gujarat,” said Rajat Duggal, an erstwhile manufacturer of plastic bags and a member of the Punjab Plastic Association.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Before the implementation of the ban, nearly 700 plastic bag manufacturer units were based in Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Morinda, Patiala, Mansa, Faridkot and Patiala.

"Tribune News Service Chandigarh, November 26 Contaminated water, erratic power supply and lack of sewerage continue to be the bane of border area residents. Dala village, 10 km from the wire fencing in Gurdaspur district, is symptomatic of villages near the Zero Line. Notwithstanding tall claims by the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), supply is erratic that has a cascading effect on basic utilities such as drinking water. Villagers spend huge sums on sinking deep bore tubewells and install diesel-operated pumpsets just to get drinking water. “One has to sink a bore well at 300 ft. And even at this depth, we get uncontaminated water. This means an expense in excess of Rs1 lakh,” a villager says. “People in this belt own small landholdings. They get a bore well dug for Rs20,000 to Rs30,000 at 60 to 70 ft and then install an RO system,” says Harpreet Dala.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The PSPCL claims it supplies uninterrupted power. The connections of waterworks are snapped when panchayats default on their bills, it says. Recently, strong winds uprooted or broke poles. The staff struggled to get things back on track for 48 hours. Villagers have a solution: they want the PSPCL to lay underground cables. Officials, however, claim they do not have the money to do so. Also, pipes from water tank to homes remain broken. Officials find it tedious to repair them in border areas. “The Punjab Rural Water Supply and Sanitation project (Phase-1), financed by the 16th World Bank Mission during the Badal’s rule spent money on improving the water supply mechanism in border villages, but the purpose was defeated by erratic power supply. Unless uninterrupted electricity is given to waterworks, the money will go down the drain,” a department official says. Tarn Taran Brackish water worries villagers   The border villages of Valtoha and Bhikhiwind are referred to as ‘khara Majha’, for their brackish underground water. In 40 villages, including Badharwal, Bhaini, Baserke, Chak Bamb, Hundal, Rajoke, Kambo Ke, Mari, Madar and Wan Tara Singh, people prefer to fetch water from hand pumps installed by the Water Supply and Sanitation Department. Satnam Singh of Hundal village says the hand pumps draw water from a depth of 550 ft. “Though waterworks have been constructed in several villages, but power supply is erratic. Many households do not have water connections.” Officials of the department claim that a survey to link more villages with the water supply chain is in progress and more waterworks are being constructed. Farmers have a reason to worry as they claim that the poor quality of underground water is affecting soil health. Most of the canal minors have already collapsed due to lack of upkeep and farmers are dependent on groundwater for irrigation. The collapse of water supply channels has also affected the disposal of waste water. With no underground sewerage, villagers have been dumping waste in overflowing ponds. At Pahuwind village, the area around Government Primary School is used for disposing of waste water. Fazilka Water filters not good enough    Reverse Osmosis (RO) water filter plants have been ineffective in border villages of the district. In Kheowali Dhab, the native village of former minister Kanshi Ram Rinwa, no one fetches water from an RO plant. A resident, Prithvi Raj, says RO plants draw groundwater, which contains a lot of impurities caused by waterlogging. The population in Kheowali Dhab and Lakhewali Dhab villages exceeds 4,000. They depend on waterworks run by the Public Health and Sanitation Department on a rotation basis, but have to compromise on water quality. “We prefer to pay Rs250 to Rs300 for each container that carries water from Gang (Bikaner) canal and use it to wash clothes and utensils,” says another villager. Rinwa had, in 1978, shown farsightedness in linking the village pond to a small drain that empties in Shehtirwala drain. But over time, encroachments have hampered the water flow. Jandwala Meerasangla village was in the news when a squall wreaked havoc in February 2003. Former sarpanch Bhagwan Dass claims that the government released funds to rebuild the village. But ground situation tells a different story. A 2,000-ft pipeline, which was laid to drain out water from the ponds, release water in 25 per cent of houses as no other outlet is available. There are few takers for RO water as many of the plants are located near public toilets. Villagers demand that RO plants should source water from canals which do not contain as many impurities as underground water. Ferozepur Streets, drains not a priority here  The SAD-BJP government doled out huge sums of money on the development of basic amenities in rural areas, but there little has changed on the ground. In Bhanewala, Jalloke, Rajoke Gatti, Kaluwala, Chandiwala, Khunder Gatti, Kamale Wala and Bhakhra villages, residents’ concern is not power or water, but the lack of sewerage. Malkit Singh of Gatti Rajo Ke village says, “Because of open drains, the condition is unbearable during the monsoon. The drains are flooded and so are the streets.” Water-borne diseases and other ailments are rampant. In some villages, sewerage pipes leak — sewage often flows into water pipes, he adds. Ajit Singh, the sarpanch of the village, says funds have not been received for sewerage. “A few years ago, we received funds for the construction of streets,” he said. The Department of Water Supply and Rural Sanitation has constructed waterworks, but many panchayats have been asked to fend for themselves. The absence of street lights is another concern. “It is difficult for elderly persons to roam in the village after dusk,” says Bagga Singh. The administration got solar lights installed last year, but none of them are functional, said Bittu of Tendiwala village. Amritsar High arsenic content  High concentration of arsenic in underground water is the bane of Amritsar district. Tests by several agencies have recorded the highest concentration of arsenic in the district of Punjab. Ask officials of the Department of Water Supply and Sanitation (DWSS) and they simply claim that drinking water is supplied to all villages of the district. They don’t talk about the arsenic content. And they do not have an action plan to address the problem. Of the 878 villages in the district, 391 face water quality issues. In all, 338 villages have high concentration of arsenic in underground water. A large number of residents of borders villages in Ramdas, Ajnala and Attari blocks are dependent on hand pumps and submersible pumps. The overhead water supply tanks in many villages have been lying defunct. Ramandeep Singh of Granthgarh village says, “The residents in small villages beyond the Ravi and those living in behaks (farmhouses) do not have water supply connections.” The DWSS had laid sewerage in three villages of the district under a World-Bank-aided project. There is no state scheme for sewerage in villages. The inhabitants of border villages are generally concerned with power supply during the paddy season. In spite of tall claims of surplus power, uninterrupted supply is a distant dream for residents here. Rattan Singh, a farmer union leader, says: “We have to gherao the subdivisional offices of the PSPCL to get eight-hour of supply for tubewells every year. Unscheduled cuts are the order of the day, even in winters.” Inputs by Ravi Dhaliwal, Manmeet Singh Gill, Raj Sadosh, Anirudh Gupta and Charanjit Singh Teja"
"Tribune News Service Chandigarh, November 2 Education is in a shambles in villages of Punjab’s border belt. Vacancies have not been filled for years, defying the guidelines of the Right to Education (RTE) Act. The less said about infrastructure the better. Of the 16 education blocks in Gurdaspur district, eight are located along the border with Pakistan. The staff strength is skeletal in these blocks. At Bhalonwali village middle school in Fatehgarh Churian block, there is just one teacher who teaches all subjects to 50 students. At Rattan Abdal village high school, Dera Baba Nanak, there are three teachers for 145 students. Amarjit Shastri, a union leader, said petty politics had ruined the education system. “Since Independence, Gurdaspur district has had seven Education Ministers. All catered to their respective vote banks,” he added.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); In 2012, then Education Minister Sewa Singh Sekhwan used Rs1 crore from the sports quota to get a stadium constructed near a private school owed by him in his native village. Incumbent Education Minister Aruna Chaudhary added the science and commerce streams in Darbar Pandori Senior Secondary School, but did not allocate adequate staff. It falls in Dinanagar Assembly segment, which she represents. “The ministers upgraded the schools, but did not recruit staff,” Shastri alleged. “Within an 8-km radius of Gurdaspur, there is no staff shortage. But outside, schools operate at just 40 per cent of their strength. No one wants to get posted in the border belt,” he added. Many buildings were constructed just to avail Central funds under the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) — without recruiting/deputing teachers. In Pathankot, there are 150 teachers who share cabs to reach their places of posting in Dera Baba Nanak and Sri Hargobindpur. “As there is no proper transfer policy, teachers spend hours commuting,” said a senior officer. Pathankot DEO Ravinder Kumar said a grant would be used to purchase desks. Other infrastructure will have to wait as the department is short of funds, he added. Amritsar One teacher for 170 students  In a blatant violation of the RTE Act, which stipulates that the pupil-teacher ratio should be 30:1 (primary) and 35:1 (upper primary), it’s as high as 170:1 in Class VIII of Government Senior Secondary School, Balharwal, 40 km from the city. Just 3 km from the international border, this school has nine teachers for 1,145 students. Thirty posts are vacant and there is no science teacher. Burewal village’s Manjit Singh said his two children were studying in the government school at Balharwal village as he couldn’t afford to send them to a private school. Here, 12 teachers are imparting education to 392 students. As many as 377 posts of teachers are lying vacant in the education blocks of Ajnala I, Ajnala-II, Chogawan-I, Chogawan-II and Attari. Government Elementary School, Aliwal village, is a single-room structure with 51 students. A teacher procured plastic chairs to spare toddlers the trouble of sitting on the floor. Government Middle School, Gurala village, has two teachers for 141 students. Many schools have to use wood and cow dung as fuel to provide mid-day meals as one LPG cylinder is insufficient for a month’s cooking. Tarn Taran Primary schools turn day-care centres  Primary schools resemble day-care centres in the absence of teachers. In most primary schools in Khalra, pupils of five classes sit together. There are just two teachers in most schools, one regular and the other hired under the employment guarantee scheme (EGS), alternative innovative education (AIE) and special trainer (STR) programmes. The primary school at Khalra has two regular teachers for 134 students. The building is old and its courtyard gets flooded during the monsoon. The teachers have pooled money to get a water tank installed. At Dodhe village, there is one regular teacher and one ‘STR’ for 80 students. At Amishah village, there are two teachers for 90 students. The border belt has over 100 teachers from Abohar, Fazilka and Mansa who were appointed recently. Many of them admitted they were trying hard to get a posting back home. “The standard of education in the border areas is pitiful. Our children are barely semi-literate,” said Satwant Singh, a retired teacher from Bhikhiwind. DEO Balbir Singh Maini said, “Teacher shortage would end after the process of rationalisation is completed.” Ferozepur Crossing river to reach campus  Malkeet Singh of Kaluwala village a student of Class X, gets up at 3 am every day. After helping his father in early-morning chores, he starts for school at 6 am. It takes two hours to reach the campus at Gatti Rajo Ke village after crossing the Sutlej on a wooden bera (raft), followed by a brisk 4-km walk. His is not an isolated case. There are several teenagers who follow this exhausting routine. Located a few 100 metres from the border, Government Senior Secondary School, Gatti Rajoke, is the only school up to Class XII which caters to almost a dozen villages. “I joined a few months ago and was pained to see the plight of these poor kids. The dropout rate was high and bunking was the norm,” said Satinder Singh, Principal. “I counselled parents who wanted their kids to help them in the fields,” he added. There are 11 teachers against 28 sanctioned posts in the school. Teaching aids are a luxury. So is the availability of drinking water and clean toilets. Paras Khullar, centre head teacher, Government Middle School, Rahime Ke village, rues that there are just four teachers for 160 students. The pupil-teacher ratio is 55:3 at the Jhugge Hajara school, 133:4 at Rajo Ke village, 88:1 at Tindiwala, 159:4 at Gatti Rahime Ke, 50:1 at Bhakhra, 126:4 at Chandiwala, 90:3 at Khunder Gatti and 140:5 at Hussainiwala. Commuting is a problem for the teachers posted here. Many of them have to board and de-board three buses, besides walking a few km to reach the campus. At times, they have to hire cabs and autos. Those who get posted are angling for a transfer, confided a teacher. The schools don’t have funds for the mid-day meal for the past three months. “I don’t know how we will keep feeding the kids,” says Khullar. Malkit Singh, DEO (Secondary), admitted that staff crunch was a perennial problem. Fazilka ‘Upgraded’ schools worst-affected  The upgrade of high schools to senior secondary in August 2016 has largely been only on paper. Shortage of classrooms, benches, potable water and vacancies of lecturers paint a gloomy picture in the border villages of Fazilka district. At Hasta Kalan village, students bring jute bags (taat) from home or just sit on the floor, braving the vagaries of weather. “As many as 200 students are forced to sit in the open,” a teacher said. Five more rooms are required to seat the students. “There is no water to drink as the groundwater is saline,” said Barjinder Singh of Class XI. At Government Senior Secondary School, Jhangar Bhaini village, a stone’s throw from the border, there are five rooms for 725 students. A block of nine rooms has already been declared unsafe. As per official sources, 21 posts of history, 20 of political science, 19 of Punjabi, 10 of economics and six of biology are vacant in 68 senior secondary schools of the district. “The vacancies will be filled and infrastructure strengthened soon,” said DEO Om Parkash Jain.

The CM’s battery of advisers promptly issue denials and statements on his behalf. Such statements at times turn out to be factually incorrect. When it was reported that Punjab’s revised power tariff was among the highest in the country, pat came the government’s denial. However, those who issued it didn’t cross-check the facts and got the tariff rates wrong. As the media threatened to lay bare the “ignorance” attributed to the CM, this clarification was immediately withdrawn and substituted with another, in which the previous government was blamed for high levies on power that had led to higher tariff.

"Amarjit Thind &Manav ManderTribune News Service Chandigarh, July 26 The vexing issue of paddy-straw burning and its harmful effect on humans and the environment has thus far proved insurmountable. The Punjab Government has now announced a $1 million “Paddy Straw Management Challenge Fund”, to be awarded to whoever finds a solution to the problem. The question agitating experts and farmers is: can there be a one-point solution to the problem, which has at least three points of focus — the harvest, processing of the straw, and the sowing of the subsequent crop? Given the spread of challenges and the experience thus far, it will require a rather large dose of luck for someone to win that $1 million, however well-intentioned the initiative. (Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Reluctance, awareness, and poverty of the farmers has been the first obstacle in all efforts and techniques developed thus far by Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana. Lack of funds has also hobbled much research. Progressive farmer Kamaldeep Singh of Sultanpur Lodhi says the high cost of a baler (Rs 10-12 lakh) — used to make bundles of straw — is crippling. While most of the wheat straw is used for fodder, it is not the case with paddy. Since the machine would be idle for most part of the year, a farmer will not be able to pay the loan instalments for it. Even if someone uses it, how will he dispose of the bales of hay? There is little market or storage space for it. Therefore, Kamaldeep Singh says, the farmer has hardly any option other than burning it on site. Then there is the Happy Seeder, which can sow wheat (subsequent crop) even with paddy stubble still standing in the field. But that does not help the potato farmers, who have to clear the field of all farm residue. Mulchers — which shred and plough stubble into the field — are a big help, but these have to be pulled by high-power tractors, which raises the cost of the tractor as well as fuel, something the debt-ridden farmers are wary of. The problem of straw burning is felt more acutely in winter, and that is not from paddy but wheat. Regarding this, Bakshish Singh of Dudwindi village says the Straw Management System (SMS), which scatters shredded stubble in the field, is also impractical since the straw does not decompose easily, and labourers transplanting paddy (subsequent crop) are reluctant to work in such fields as they work barefoot. Farmers also end up wasting more water by keeping the fields flooded for the straw to decompose. The very purpose of delaying the paddy season by two weeks is then defeated, he explained. Dr JS Mahal, Dean, College of Agriculture Engineering and Technology, PAU, says farmers have not shown interest in adopting the Happy Seeder. That is because the gains of this technology — in the form of better soil health — becomes evident only after three or four years. In 2012, the university had promoted production biogas from paddy stubble by dry fermentation. “It is an effective technique and the residue left is used as manure, but again the costs are high. The state announced a subsidy but that too failed to attract the farmers,” says Dr BS Sooch, senior research scientist. Dr RK Gupta, senior soil chemist, Department of Soil Sciences, points to another technique, “biochar” produced from stubble. It is now being publicised by Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) at Ladowal, Jalandhar, Amritsar, Gurdaspur and Bathinda. This technique reduces pollution and the use of the residue improves soil health, improves water infiltration rate as well as water holding capacity of the soil. The Centre too has chipped in on the paddy straw problem. Union Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan announced on November 11, 2016, that a new plant to produce ethanol to be set up in Bathinda with an outlay of Rs 500 crore. The plant was to convert paddy residue into ethanol, which would provide additional income to farmers. The then Deputy Chief Minister, Sukhbir Singh Badal, had said such plants would be set up in every district in league with private players. He added this initiative would give farmers an extra Rs 3,000-4,000 per acre. The foundation stone of the plant was laid in December 2016, but since the change of government the fate of the project is not known. It is clear the challenge lies at the wider interface of governance and technology. Yet, the initiative of a reward has received appreciation for at least triggering fresh interest in the critical subject."

"Tribune News Service Moga, June 7Rain lashed Moga and its adjoining districts last night bringing some respite to the residents from the heat wave. However, the season’s first pre-monsoon showers exposed the quality of construction works going on the Ludhiana-Moga-Talwandi Bhai National Highway. The rain damaged the newly constructed road at many points on the 78-km stretch, disrupting vehicular movement. The national highway has worn out from many places, exposing potholes and uneven stretches, making the journey of motorists dangerous. The bad condition of the road also posed great difficulty to the commuters within the municipal limits of Moga city. Many vehicles were seen stuck in potholes. JCB machines were pushed into service to pull out the vehicles. Meanwhile, a truck driver alleged that the axle and suspension of his truck were damaged due to the shoddy and poor construction works. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Moreover, all the pits dug up for raising the pillars and other construction works have got filled with rainwater, thus, providing breeding ground to mosquitoes and other insects."
"Sarbjit Dhaliwal Tribune News Service Chandigarh, May 21 With no funds in its kitty, the Punjab Mandi Board is worried over the repair of rural roads. As per rules, a rural road is to be repaired every six years. But most stretches of the rural road network have not been repaired for the past eight to nine years. “At some places, the road network has ceased to exist. It has become difficult for people to commute on such roads,” said Lal Singh, chairman of the Mandi Board. “I am flooded with requests for the repair of roads in the countryside,” he said, blaming the previous government for creating a mess on this front.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The task of laying roads and repairing the existing ones is divided between the Mandi Board and the PWD (Buildings and Roads). But the Mandi Board funds the entire exercise. About Rs2,900 crore is required to repair 23,000-km-long road network in villages. However, almost the entire income of the board is pledged with several banks, from which a loan of Rs550 crore has been raised for five years to complete projects. There are three types of rural roads. One, that connect a town with another via villages. Two, that connect a village with another. And third, that lead to villages from the outskirts of rural areas. Lal Singh said there was a 9,276-km network of roads which linked a town or a city with others through villages. “The first priority is to repair roads used the most by villages,” the board chairman said. Then, there is an 8,600-km road network that links two villages. “The repair of this road network will be next on the priority list,” he said. About the funds, Lal Singh said it was the most difficult question. “I will discuss the matter with Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh. One way out is to raise a loan for the repair of roads,” he said. “The board will also approach the Centre that has some funds at its command for the rural road network,” he added."

"Tribune News Service  Chandigarh, April 21 More than 500 applications moved under the Right to Information (RTI) Act by a ‘habitual’ Ludhiana-based activist have irked the State Information Commission (SIC) to an extent that it has directed the Municipal Corporation, Ludhiana, to ignore the RTI queries by the applicant, who is “running riot by filing repeated applications seeking inane information.” Delivering an unusual order, the commission observed that RTI activism of this man had “drastically hampered” the routine work of the MC, Ludhiana, as a large number of employees and officials remained busy either in dealing with his RTI queries or to prepare replies in response to appeals filed by him to appellate authorities. Otherwise mandated to facilitate information to RTI applicants, the commission took the decision today while hearing cases pertaining to RTI applications filed by Amarjit Singh Dhamotia of Ludhiana, who has filed more than 500 applications under the RTI Act. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });While disposing of pleas filed by Dhamotia, State Information Commissioner Yashvir Mahajan observed, “The duty of the commission is to see that such blatant misuse of the RTI Act should not be allowed further and such situation needs to be appropriately dealt with to secure the faith of the public in the ‘sunshine Act’ and remove obstacles in functioning of public authority, which would eventually prevent public authority from focusing on transparency.” The SIC further observed, “the applicant’s act of running riot by filing repeated applications seeking inane and voluminous information has become counter-productive of public interest. The commission cannot allow such fishing operations of the appellant. We see his act as misuse rather abuse of the RTI Act with unsavoury motives. The commission accordingly disposes of all appeals in hand in terms of Section 7 (9) of the RTI Act and allows the public authority to ignore his applications in future.” It was held that the RTI applications filed by the person had drastically hampered the routine work of the MC, Ludhiana. The SIC said many MC officers were all day busy in dealing with his RTI queries, whereas other officers had to visit the SIC to file reply in the commission on the appeals filed by Dhamotia. "
"Saurabh Malik Tribune News Service Chandigarh, April 14 The Supreme Court has made it clear that proceedings in matrimonial disputes can be conducted through video-conferencing. Consequently, the Punjab and Haryana High Court is believed to be working out modalities for recording evidence of estranged couples living separately at places falling in the jurisdiction of different courts.  The High Court is flooded with petitions by alienated partners for transfer of cases, primarily to courts under whose jurisdiction they reside. “Generally, it is the wife’s convenience which must be looked at by the courts, while deciding a transfer application… The distance between the two places, financial status of the wife, her source of income, as well as her age, are relevant factors to be considered,” a Punjab and Haryana High Court Bench had only recently asserted. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });“We understand that in every district in the country, video-conferencing is now available. Wherever such facility is available, it ought to be fully utilised and all High Courts ought to issue appropriate administrative instructions to regulate the use of video-conferencing for certain category of cases.  “Matrimonial cases, where one of the parties resides outside court’s jurisdiction, are one of such categories. Wherever one or both the parties make a request for use of video-conference, proceedings may be conducted on video-conferencing, obviating the need of the party to appear in person. In several cases, this court has directed recording of evidence by video-conferencing,” the Bench of Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel and Justice Uday Umesh Lalit ruled. It observed one could not ignore the problem faced by a husband, if the proceedings were transferred due to genuine difficulties faced by a wife. The husband may find it difficult to contest proceedings at a place convenient to the wife. Transfer, as such, was not always a solution acceptable to both parties.  “It may be appropriate that the available technology of video-conferencing is used where both parties have equal difficulty and there is no place which is convenient to both parties.”  The Bench said every district court was required have an e-mail ID and a designated officer/manager of a district court may suitably respond to such e-mail.

"Ruchika M Khanna Tribune News Service Chandigarh, February 4 Punjab recorded 78.62 per cent polling, almost the same as in 2012 (78.67), as the state went to the hustings today to elect 117 representatives for the 14th Assembly. But for a few incidents of firing, skirmishes and technical glitches in VVPAT machines, polling was by and large peaceful. The turnout in rural constituencies was higher than those in urban segments. Mansa, with a large number  of rural votes, recorded the highest poll percentage at 87.34 while the majority urban SAS Nagar saw the lowest turnout at 71.97. The Election Commission was expecting the percentage to go as high as 85.  (Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The high-pitched election saw a three-cornered contest among the Akali Dal-BJP alliance, the Congress and new entrant Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). There were two incidents of violence. Akali and Congress supporters clashed at Lalu Ghuman village in Tarn Taran and Ropowali village in Fatehgarh Churian. There were incidents of firing outside a polling booth in Guruharsahai and at Lohgarh village in Dera Bassi constituency. “We have registered cases against the accused in all cases. Barring these, polling was peaceful. We had put in place an unprecedented security cover, deputing 30,400 personnel of the central security forces and 55,000 of the Punjab Police,” said Chief Electoral Officer, Punjab, VK Singh, and ADGP VK Bhawra. The latter said after the twin blasts in Maur, anti-terror SWAT teams had been deployed too.  The voting, that began at 8 am, was brisk till noon, but slowed down in many constituencies in the afternoon. While reports of cash and liquor being distributed to woo voters flooded the social media, the election authorities said they had received no such complaints. “Other than the 100 election observers in the state, assigned by the Election Commission, 8,166 micro-observers were appointed by us, and they will file a report from the ground. Appropriate action will be taken if attempts to influence voters have been made,” said Singh. After Delhi, AAP has set its hopes on staking claim to power in Punjab, even as the ruling alliance and the Congress have used their might to stop the new entrant. With the youth seemingly swaying towards AAP, it looks like the party has an advantage. But vote mechanics played out by the two arch rivals of Punjab politics — including consolidation of the Hindu urban votes as well as those of three deras, “Punjabi versus outsider” campaign and accusation of AAP’s alliance with radicals  — made the contest tough, with each party having its pockets of influence.  Whether AAP’s strategy to win over young voters (more than 50 per cent of the electorate)  did succeed  will be only known on the counting day, March 11."

Going by betting trends in Moga, Bathinda, Ludhiana, Mohali, Jalandhar and Amritsar districts, AAP will get 45 to 51 seats; the Congress, 44 to 50 seats; and SAD-BJP and others, 17 to 20 seats. Punters betting on Aam Aadmi Party will get Rs 2 to Rs 4 in return for every rupee if the party gets the majority (59-plus seats). And if the Congress forms the government, bookies will get Rs 1.50 to Rs 3. Ask people and they are sceptical of Aam Aadmi Party forming the government. They say the Congress will form the government on the back of Capt Amarinder Singh’s stature.

It killed the dream of people of this country about an alternative politics,” he says. To contest all 117 seats, he says, means helping Akalis retain power.

"Aparna Banerji Located amid lush-green fields, the Jamsher dairy complex looks incongruous, a desolate wasteland in the back of beyond. Bad roads, pools of stagnant water and alleys inundated with sewage – the promise of making it a “state of the art” locality has sunk without a trace. The complex is among the three ills that plague the rural areas of Jalandhar Cantonment constituency, the others being the proposed solid waste treatment plant (STP) at Jamsher village and the water treatment plant at Pholariwal. The “people-unfriendly” threesome has triggered a series of protests by the villagers against the state government. Satpal, a 60-year-old Nanak Pindi resident, says agitatedly, “Our villages have turned into a dump. Should we live in this hell or simply die?” With a jump, he crosses a concrete fence dividing the street from the flooded alley and stands knee-deep in a stinking pool of sludge. “This dung-heavy water is not only spreading diseases but also eating into the foundations of our houses.” He tells us that the villagers have lost count of the politicians and officials they’ve met over the issue. “Pargat Singh (sitting MLA) came here a few years ago. Sarabjit Makkar (Akali candidate) visited recently. They all know about our problems, but have failed to come up with any solution,” he says. His neighbour, Inderjit Singh, who owns a dairy, wants to be heard too. He shouts, “The mosquitoes don’t spare us even in the winter. Our skin is covered with rashes and boils.” The flooded street has snapped their access to each other. In the monsoon, say residents, the water enters their houses as well. The villagers claim that their metal utensils, wire meshes and taps rust within months due to the toxins from the two “ganda nullahs” flowing near the complex, which has over 300 dairies.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Shifted to the complex over a decade ago, the dairy owners are a disillusioned lot. They call themselves the government’s forgotten vote bank, conveniently pushed out of the city with promises of development that were never fulfilled. Anil Chander, an entrepreneur, says, “We are residents of urban areas who have set up dairies here. Initially, some roads were built, but the kutcha ones are clogged with sewage. Some of us also built houses here, only to realise later that it’s just not feasible to live in such surroundings.” The proposed STP has added fuel to the fire. The hot-button issue became the prime reason for Pargat’s exit from the SAD as he took up the cudgels on behalf of the villagers. Kanwaljit Kaur, sarpanch of Chitebani village, had threatened to immolate herself last year if the government went ahead with the project. She refuses to budge from her stand: “We won’t allow any politician to enter our village unless they give a written undertaking that the STP will be scrapped. Stray animals plunder our crops, the dairy waste chokes our streets and now they want to dump garbage here. We will die before letting that happen. We are backing Pargat because he took on the government for our sake.” To make matters worse, drugs have made inroads into the area in the past few years. Former Jamsher sarpanch Harinder Singh Bittu Shah says, “In the past year, at least seven villagers have succumbed to drugs. And that bad disease (AIDS) has also reared its ugly head. Seven years ago, the Sadar police station from the city was shifted here. Ironically, the drug menace has tightened its grip since then. We don’t know what the cops are doing.” The voters of the constituency’s urban area have a different set of problems. Their long-pending demands: abolition of ‘undue’ octroi, access to a peripheral road and mobile connectivity. The cantonments of Jalandhar and Ferozepur are the only ones in the state where octroi is still being levied. “We’ll get it abolished” — several politicians have used this line to woo voters ahead of one election after the other. The promise was made by SAD candidates Jagbir Brar and Pargat Singh in the 2007 and 2012 Assembly poll, respectively. Both won; it was the voters who lost faith. As per information obtained under the RTI Act, octroi to the tune of over Rs61 crore has been collected from residents over the past decade. Harvinder Setia, a trader, says, “Octroi was abolished across 133 MCs as per the state government’s 2006 gazette notification, which instead levied 10 per cent surcharge on VAT. In a 2008 notification, Jalandhar and Ferozepur Cantonment Boards were also exempted from paying it. However, dual charges are being imposed on us illegally.” The boundary walls erected by the Army near Dhina village and on a stretch at Hallotali village have restricted the movement of commuters between the urban and rural areas. The structures have also blocked the link roads meant for inter-village connectivity. Locals have been fighting for access to the phirni road for the past many years, with over 100 RTI applications being filed. For the time being, they have no option but to make a detour of 6 km or more to reach their destination. Ram Sehdev, a local entrepreneur, says, “We have been let down by all parties. Pargat did make efforts regarding the peripheral road, but he drew a blank over his 16-point manifesto. We have even approached the Centre in vain. It all boils down to political will, which is lacking.” In the age of smartphones, cantonment residents are heavily dependent on the landline. Reason: This is a high-security area where private mobile phone towers are a no-no. Still stuck in the 20th century? Yes, many of them do feel that way at times."
"Sanjeev Singh Bariana Late in the evening, after the Chak Ramsahai mine is closed for the day, Tarsem Lal, a chemist of Sehora village, hears the roar of trucks carrying sand from illegal quarries along the Ravi riverbed. “Officially, sand mining can’t be done after sunset, but our families have to bear the rattle of machinery and vehicles throughout the evening and the night,” he says. Only this mine is operational out of the five in Bhoa constituency, but that’s the official line. A senior officer confides on the condition of anonymity, “There are confirmed reports of illegal mining at certain places, but we don’t have adequate manpower to curb the menace.” Excuse or explanation? That’s anybody’s guess. Jeevam Ram, a retired government official from Polla village, gives us a glimpse of the terror unleashed by the mining mafia. “Reta badmaash chakwande ne. Kise ‘don’ de ishare te kam karde ne. ‘Don’ vi kyee ne, uchchi uchchi thhan te. Raat nu daaru peeti hundi hai  mulazman ne, so asin darde haan. Police aithe aundi nahin te na hi sarkaar. Je sarkaar dilon chhave taan hi kucch ho sakda hai (Sand is illegally lifted at the behest of the don’s goons. There are many influential ‘dons’. The goons get drunk at night… we are scared. Neither the police nor the government comes here. If the government sincerely wants to end this menace, it can be done).” When asked to identify these “dons”, Tarsem Lal says evasively: “Eh saanu na puccho. Pata sarian nu hai (Everyone knows who they are).” Moving ahead, The Tribune team takes a turn, traversing a badly damaged road at Saab Chakk. A truck without a registration number is seen ferrying sand. Azhar Mehmood, who is managing his stables, says, “Pata nahin kaun ne. Hairaani hundi hai, eh main road chhad ke tutti sadak te kitthe jaande ne (I don’t know who they are. I am surprised why they leave the main road and travel on this one).” We can’t say with certainty whether he is expressing ignorance or taking us for a ride.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Prince Pal, a Class-XII passout who works as a motor mechanic, highlights the other ills plaguing the area. “The entire district (Pathankot) has no industry, so no jobs are available. The neighbourhood is flooded with ‘chitta’(drugs). The suppliers, who are outsiders, come in their vehicles and distribute it openly. They keep changing the spot where the addicts are given their daily fix. This is happening right under the nose of the local administration and the police,” says Prince, who is doing a course at a private polytechnic in the hope of bettering his job prospects. The bus stand at Bamial was inaugurated in February last year, but it wears a deserted look. A big settlement near the Indo-Pak border, Bamial has a market that caters to the adjoining areas. Walking through a maze of crowded shops, an elderly Nachhatar Singh wonders why a remote corner of the village was picked to establish the bus stand. “One has to cross the whole market to reach there,” he says, frustration writ large on his face. There are several roads crying for attention, including Bamial-Janial, Janial Chakkk Amir and Dostpur-Kot Bhattian. Ajay Singh, a member of the Taloor village panchayat, says, “Pontoon bridges have come up at places such as Sakol along the border. This still does not solve the problem for a major chunk of the people who are left stranded in their villages, particularly during the monsoon. Getting heavy machinery and luggage here continues to be a big issue. We still need bridges at many other places, including Taash and Mastpur.” According to Hazoori Lal, a social activist, the functioning of the government offices leaves a lot to be desired. The tehsildar office at Bamial opens only once a week, while the one at Narot Jaimal Singh opens only twice, much to the chagrin of the public. “Other offices are no better,” he adds. The scenario is no better in the government hospitals. Ramesh Lal, a retired schoolteacher from Sehora, says, “The hospital in our village caters to nine villages. However, we don’t have even a single doctor on duty.” The government hospital at Bamial, which covers nearly a dozen villages, is only marginally better: It has one doctor and bare-minimum infrastructure. With the code of conduct likely to be announced shortly, BJP MLA Seema Kumari is going all out to get the roads metalled. Surinder Pal, who runs a shop on the Sunderchakk-Bamial road, can see through these last-ditch efforts. He puts it bluntly: “A one-kilometre stretch on the left side of my shop got a concrete layer only day before yesterday. The MLA is in a tearing hurry to erase more than four years of non-performance.” Ram Singh of Anyal village, a wizened old man, knows the political game inside out, having seen it closely over the decades. “Bana te lokan nu moorakh rahe ne par lok ajj kal shauq naal bande ne (These days, people prefer to be befooled),” he says. The way things are, his cynicism is hard to contest."
"Tribune News Service   Patiala,  October 19  Patiala MP Dharamvira Gandhi’s Bill to amend Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985, has been cleared by the legislative branch after scrutiny. This is the second Bill by Gandhi to be accepted for tabling in Parliament, the first being Sikh Marriage Act, 2016. The Bill aims to provide relief to common drug users through cheap, regulated and medically supervised supply of traditional and natural intoxicants.  Gandhi has for a long been seeking amendments to the NDPS Act, claiming that rather than helping in controlling drugs, the current NDPS Act was producing contrary results. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });“The NDPS Act has produced results contrary to the desired results.Thirty years after its enactment, the fact remains that the NDPS Act has failed to control flow of drugs. Instead, it has led to the birth of drug mafia which has destroyed innumerable lives,” said Gandhi. The Act had made recreational substances unavailable to the common man, he said, adding that newer, more potent, addictive and dangerous alternative drugs had flooded the markets. He contended that common users had turned to easily available street drugs. He said a National Crime Record Bureau report showed that 88 per cent of those jailed under the NDPS were common users and only 2 per cent traffickers and distributors were sent behind the bars. He said, “India is currently facing a massive problem of drugs, with citizens between 15-40 years of age habitually using harmful substances. It is time to treat drug abuse as a health issue instead of taking it as a crime against society.” He said the amendment Bill would most likely to be tabled during the winter session. Once enacted, the Bill would provide relief to common drug users through cheap, regulated and medically supervised supply of traditional and natural intoxicants, he said, adding that this would help society in getting rid of dangerous medical and synthetic drugs.

"Aman Sood Tribune News Service Patiala, October 11 Flooded with requests for the allotment of new vehicles from officers, the Punjab Government has ordered auction of old vehicles but instead of allotting new cars, the Finance Department has asked them to “hire vehicles.” Sources confirmed that in the past two months the Finance Department had been flooded with requests from various department heads pertaining to release of funds for buying new cars after their present vehicles were in a bad shape. “However, they gave permission to auction the condemned vehicles but asked the departments to follow instructions as per the policy of December, 2014,” they said. In one such letter to a government department in June, 2016, the Home Department told certain departments to “ensure the auction of condemned vehicles and later follow the new policy to take vehicles on a rent as per entitlement.” Interestingly, the 2014 directions mention that given the financial condition of the government, “the requests for allotment of new vehicles cannot be met.”(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); “From now, the Finance Department will not sanction any new vehicle for these departments. They shall also stop purchasing replacement vehicles,” states the policy.  As per the policy approved for all officers, including Deputy Commissioners, police officers and District and Session Judges, the upper cap limit has been fixed along with the category of vehicles allotted per officer. “While the Deputy Commissioners’ vehicles will be entitled to run 2,500 km per month, Inspector General, range DIGs and SSP-level officers will be entitled to 2,350 km per month. SDMs and those officers working as Executive Magistrates in the districts will be entitled to run the hired cabs for 2,200 km per month,” reads the policy, a copy of which is with The Tribune.  An SSP-level officer said it was completely impractical for them to use rented vehicles, given odd duty hours and security concerns. “These vehicles will run for not more than 12 hours in a day and will not run on four days in a month. These vehicles will go out in the field only if the officer, who has been allotted the vehicle, is going on official duty,” reads the policy. The officer allotted the vehicle would be responsible for its proper utilisation, it says. Already the neighbouring state of Haryana has put in place a similar policy in September, 2016, allowing departments to outsource vehicles and drivers from private transport companies for certain categories of officials. “The government spends crores for its ministers but officers in the fields will now be using cabs,” said one such officer entitled to an Innova, but his request was recently turned down and he was asked to hire a taxi instead."

"New Delhi, June 27 At a time when climate change is set to impact rice production in Asia, simple water management by farmers as an adaptation strategy will minimise the damage, an expert said. “Climate change will impact rice production in large parts of Asia, including India. Water management will be a key feature of decisions aimed at adapting to the impact of climate change,” Dennis Wichelns, Senior Research Fellow of Thailand-based Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), said during the Knowledge Forum on Climate Resilient Development in Himalayan and Downstream Regions held here recently. The event was organised jointly by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development and the Delhi-based Institute of Economic Growth (IEG). According to Wichelns, improvement in water management will help in areas where higher temperatures are likely and where a shift in the rainfall pattern is expected. In certain areas, crop yields will increase in some seasons, perhaps in response to higher rainfall during the production cycle or with a reduction in summer days in the northern region. In other areas, yields might be reduced due to higher night temperatures, untimely drought conditions, or submergence caused by massive natural events. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });According to Wichelns, an improvement in water management will also help in reducing methane emissions and arsenic uptake in the rice fields. “Methane is a potent greenhouse gas. It is estimated that up to 20 per cent of the anthropogenic releases of methane to the atmosphere are generated in agriculture, largely by livestock and in rice production,” he said. “The anaerobic conditions in which paddy rice is produced is largely responsible for the methane generation and release. Methanogenic organisms, which thrive in anaerobic conditions, break down carbonaceous materials and form methane,” he added. He said rice production generated a substantial amount of methane annually, thus adding notably to the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere each year. Switching from flooded paddy production to aerobic rice production or to alternative crops that are produced in aerobic conditions can substantially reduce regional methane emissions, Wichelns added. — IANS "

"Ruchika M Khanna Tribune News Service Chandigarh, September 28 Faced with 60 per cent loss to cotton crop in the Malwa region, the Punjab Government has okayed a Rs 600-crore compensation package for the affected farmers. The report of a special girdawri ordered by the Punjab Government shows that 6.75 lakh acres under cotton crop have been affected in a whitefly attack. Cotton was sown on 11.25 lakh acres in the Malwa region this year. Farmers have ploughed back crop on 11,800 acres because of the pest attack. The crop failure is not only because of the pest attack, but also because of spurious pesticides that flooded the state markets, and were unknowingly used by farmers to control the whitefly attack. The failure of cotton crop in the state has acquired political overtones, which the “pro-farmer” Akali-BJP government is finding difficult to battle.

"Ruchika M. Khanna Tribune News Service Chandigarh, May 14 A majority of mega project developers, including those having allegiance with the ruling Akali-BJP government, have failed to set up their projects in the state within the stipulated time. They are seeking extension in time to implement the project, besides certain changes and more concessions. Official sources said the state government was flooded with requests from scores of investors who have signed MoUs with the Industry Department since 2007 for mega projects, asking for either extension in time or seeking additional fiscal concessions such as exemption in stamp duty or electricity duty.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); One of the clauses under the mega project policy states in case the developer fails to start his project within the stipulated time, all concessions given to him will be withdrawn. But the government, probably to avoid itself an embarrassment, is allowing extensions and concessions by simply asking the developers to contribute towards the cancer relief fund (up to Rs50 lakh). The government has drawn flak from the Opposition parties over the projects that fail to take off even as the state Investment Promotion Bureau (earlier Industry Department) maintains that it has okayed investment proposals worth over Rs19,000 crore since 2007. Those who are seeking exemptions include developers considered close to the top government functionaries. Janta Land Promotors owned by Kulwant Singh, who contested the Lok Sabha election on SAD ticket, has sought revision in his mixed use integrated industrial park project in Mohali. Shipra Estates has sought an extension in project implementation till 2020 (though the screening committee has approved extension till 2018). Ritesh Properties has also sought extension in project implementation (granted till 2018). A meeting to okay these extensions, besides allowing Trident Agritech to shelve its integrated sugar processing mega project in Sangrur, was held last evening. For Janta Land Promoters and Ritesh Properties, the Housing Department has been asked to conduct an audit and inspection of the physical and financial progress of these projects. On April 15, the last meeting of the empowered committee headed by Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, a number of requests were put up seeking extension. These include the case of Bharat Hotels that is setting up a hotel in Amritsar, Ludhiana integrated textile park, a multiplex by Sarup Industries and another by Parv Promoters – both in Jalandhar, Shipra Estates in Zirakpur and industrial park by Ritesh Properties among others. All these have been recommended for approval by the screening committee to the empowered committee for a final decision. Similarly, the developers seeking tax exemptions include Steel Strips and Wheels, which is seeking special package for its mega project, and Guru Gobind Singh Refinery. A policy decision on stamp duty exemption to industrial component in mixed use mega industrial parks on the pattern of electricity duty exemption too is under consideration. Official sources say the reason the state is ready to offer these concessions is that it wants investments to mature. “We are willing to give concessions, including extension in project implementation. We will also consider grant of fiscal benefits because we want to change the Punjab economy from being primarily agrarian to being an industrial economy,” says a senior officer in the government. He is perhaps only echoing what the Deputy Chief Minister recently told another gathering of businessmen at a FICCI event."

The staff is seen misbehaving with the police officials also.” Besides, there are a few people who have even defended Sukhbir by writing that it was the fault of his staff and he should not be blamed. However, Sukhbir was yet to reply to any of their posts, either individually or jointly. "
"Archit Watts Tribune News Service Muktsar, April 27 Well-off farmers in the district have started selling their produce from their fields instead of bringing it to the mandis, which is violation of the rules. Instead of taking action against such farmers, the state procurement agencies are buying wheat from them and that too on a priority, indicating a nexus between the farmers and the officials concerned. In contrast, the local grain market is flooded with wheat and there is hardly any space for even vehicles to move. The farmers are forced to face scorching heat while waiting for the buyers. Speaking over the phone, Kulbir Singh Matta, District Mandi Officer, Muktsar, said: “No government agency is authorised to procure wheat from any place other than the notified area. We will keep a check on such practices.” Sources in the district administration revealed well-off farmers were selling their produce direct from the fields using their political clout even as marginal farmers are struggling in mandis. As per official records, 96,611 tonnes of wheat has been purchased in Muktsar. Of this, 74,159 tonnes is still lying in mandis. It means that just 22,452 tonnes of wheat has been lifted so far. Besides, there is huge stock of wheat which has not been purchased as yet. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });Some farmers of Lakhewali today blocked a road demanding that the wheat lifting process should be expedited. Besides, the government is yet to start making payment to commission agents. Though it had announced that the farmers would be given money for their produce within 48 hours of its purchase, nothing has happened till date. "
"Arun Sharma Tribune News Service Ropar, April 23 Illegal mining has been continuing unabated in Ropar district despite a hue and cry by the public here. The involvement of huge money, vested interests of a section of local people and political patronage proved stronger than any measure taken up by district administration (albeit half-heartedly) to check it. Political parties can be seen trading allegations on the issue, but the fact remains that many from major parties, including the Congress, BJP and the SAD, have stake in the illegal business. Mining Minister Madan Mohan Mittal belongs to this district and he represents the Anandpur Sahib Assembly constituency. The district has 232 crushers, many of which are operational without any permission. According to rough estimates, at least 50 truckloads of material is supplied by each of these every day. These crushers receive the required material from neighbouring Himachal Pradesh as well. The supply is mostly local, but its volume is much more than what is supposed to be extracted from six operational quarries at Surewal, Kiratpur, Bhalan, Algran, Dayapur and Palasi villages. “Goonda” tax is also a reality in the district.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); RTI activist Dinesh Chadha who often raises voice against illegal mining and “goonda” tax said legal mining being conducted in a small portion of the district had proved to be a camouflage for the illegal trade. The volume of sand and gravel extracted from here was many times more than what the contractors were allowed to quarry, he said. Satya Devi and Bhagwati Devi, owners of more than four acres at Surewal village, said a contractor from Anandpur Sahib got contract of quarrying sand from the mines near their village. One day, they noticed that the sand was being lifted from their land, thus creating a big crater there. When they protested, the said contractor offered them a price against permission to lift sand from their land, they said. An agreement was signed between them and then the contractor dug out sand from there. Now whenever they made a phone call to the contractor to demand the agreed amount, they were told that he was not available, they said. The contractor was allowed to dig up to 10 feet only. But he dug much deeper and now it was not possible to measure the exact depth of the crater as it was flooded with underground water, said Shyam Sunder, Bhagwati Devi’s son. At Kiratpur Sahib, residents of nearby Chandpur village have been spending sleepless nights for the past many years as there was heavy machinery at work throughout the night to extract sand and gravel from the Sutlej. To camouflage their misdeeds, unscrupulous elements first collect the material at some crusher during the night and shift it during the day, portraying it as an old stock. No villager dares to raise a voice against the sand mafia. Though several villagers confirmed that mining was done in the Sutlej near their village every night, none of them was ready to divulge names of the offenders. A villager, however, agreed to show the route to the river used by the sand mafia. He himself disappeared at least one km before the destination, saying that going any further could create problems for him. A resident of adjoining Gajpur village said they went to the local police station six months ago requesting to put a check on the illegal activity near their village. The police official present there, however, expressed his helplessness saying they were people of very influential politicians, he alleged. The illegal mining, however, was not restricted to this part of the district. The writ of sand mafia also runs large in Bharatgarh, Nurpur Bedi, Ropar and Chamkaur Sahib areas. Residents of Nurpur Bedi area staged several dharnas protesting against illegal mining and damage to roads due to plying of heavy machinery and tippers in the area, only to face disappointment at the hands of the police and the district administration. The contractors are allowed to extract a little over two lakh tonnes of sand and gravel per annum from the six allotted quarries. Toll plaza officials at Nakkian, near Kiratpur Sahib, said more than 5,000 tippers carrying a minimum of 30 tonnes of sand and gravel pass through that area every month. These calculations confirmed that at least 1.5 lakh tonne of sand and gravel was being ferried from Nangal and Anandpur Sahib to other parts of the state and neighbouring Chandigarh and Haryana every month. Ropar SSP, however, denied that the police had failed to check illegal mining. “We have deputed a permanent force with the Mining Department so that they can take prompt action against offenders. Around 15 complaints have been registered during the past three months,” he added. General Manager of the Mining Department Tehal Singh Sekhon said action was taken whenever they got any information about illegal mining. There was a shortage of staff in the district. “The district has only eight guards to keep account of the material being extracted from six mines and to check illegal mining. One officer looks after Nurpur Bedi, Chamkaur Sahib and Morinda blocks, while another has been handed over the responsibility of Ropar and Majri blocks in Mohali district. A woman block-level officer is deputed at Nangal and Anandpur Sahib, where all operational six quarries are situated,” he added."
"Chandigarh, February 28    The first full year budget of the BJP led government at the Centre has left the Punjab industry disappointed, with its representatives stating it has not lived up to expectations. Punjab's industry particularly MSME sector had pinned big hopes from the Union Budget 2015-16, presented by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday, for announcing industry friendly steps to provide relief to old and cottage industry from the onslaught of cheap imports as well as reducing excise duty for enabling it to face stiff competition. ""We are completely disappointed with the budget. It has failed to address our concerns and issues which were pointed out to the Union Finance Minister,"" Jalandhar-based Khel Udyog Sangh president Ravinder Dheer said. Accusing the Union minister of ""utterly ignoring"" cottage industry's issues, Dheer said, ""There was no mention of levying anti-dumping duty on cheap imports of sports goods from other countries. There was also no word on removing central excise duty on sports goods in the budget.""         The Jalandhar-based sports goods industry, which is one of the oldest industrial clusters, had sought from the Centre rollback of 2 per cent central excise duty on sports goods. Besides, it had also sought levying of anti-dumping duty on cheap import of sport equipment from countries including China, Pakistan, Taiwan. ""Sports goods like cricket bat, hockey, etc. imported from countries like China, Pakistan and Taiwan have flooded the domestic market, which had dealt a severe blow to Jalandhar's manufacturing activity,"" he asserted.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Sports goods industry developed in Jalandhar after skilled Hindu craftsmen migrated from Pakistan's Sialkot area after partition in 1947. Similarly, 60 km from Jalandhar, Ludhiana's bicycle industry said there was lack of ""corrective"" steps in the budget for boosting manufacturing activity. ""No step was taken in the budget to address our concerns particularly regarding bicycle sector,"" Badish Jindal, said President Federation of Small Industries of India. Ludhiana based bicycle makers had sought withdrawal of 2 per cent central excise duty on bicycles and Centre's intervention in curbing import of ""cheap"" Chinese bicycles via countries such as Sri Lanka and Bangladesh by paying ""lower"" custom charges. Ludhiana, a major industrial hub, caters to over 90 per cent of the country’s bicycle and bicycle parts requirements. Punjab's MSME sector comprising about 15 lakh units said the union budget did not take any decision with regard to raising central excise exemption limit from Rs 1.50 crore to Rs 3 crore. — PTI"
"Our Correspondent Abohar, February 26 The leakage of water through pressure release valves fixed on the floor bed of the Gang (Bikaner) canal has triggered waterlogging in Khuikhera and neighbouring villages on the Abohar-Fazilka road. The loss accessed at 250-300 cusecs has deprived hundreds of farmers in the neighbouring Sriganganagar district of west Rajasthan. Farmers of both the district had a meeting at Sriganganagar today and submitted a memorandum to Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhra Raje through the district administration. They warned of agitation on March 2 if the leakage was not checked. The deputation from Fazilka was led by Prem Kumar, former vice-chairman, zila parishad. Kisan Sangharsh Samiti spokesman Subhash Sehgal led the farmers of Sriganganagar. The memorandum, also signed by former Punjab Agriculture Minister Chaudhary Radha Krishan and Kamla Devi, sarpanch of Khuikhera village, said at least 1,000 acres of agriculture land had been affected by waterlogging near the canal. The land had produced bumper crop when the canal remained closed for a year to take up remodelling work in 2003. Most of the pressure release valves got damaged resulting in leakage and seepage in the floor bed. The havoc wrecked by the menace had made hundreds of farmers debt- ridden. On the other side, hundreds of farmers in Sriganganagar border district were getting 300 cusecs lesser water than the actual discharge from Ferozepur headworks. The Executive Engineer of the Drainage Construction Division, Ferozepur, had prepared a project amounting to Rs 250.15 lakh for constructing sub-surface drainage system for Khuikhera village confirming that the area was badly affected by waterlogging. Due to canal seepage and rain, the entire area gets flooded and causes heavy damage to agriculture land and village colonies, the report said. The project is yet to see the light of the day.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The farmers demanded that all the valves and pipes linked with these should be removed."

"Tribune News Service Faridkot, February 4 They came, they saw and they zipped away, leaving behind residents to wonder who would be the next VVIP to descend on them to “take stock” of the situation in Mari Mustafa village, where a number of residents have died of cancer and hepatitis C. The antipathy of the residents in Mari Mustafa to such visits is understandable, as VVIP visits to this village in the past two months have brought them nothing but empty assurances. After finding out that 16 per cent of the population in Mari Mustafa is infected with hepatitis C (HCV), a chronic liver disease, and a large number of residents in the village are suffering from cancer, the village residents were flooded with “solace and sympathy” two months ago as political leaders made a beeline for Mari Mustafa.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Vijay Sampla, Union Minister of State for Social Justice, many ministers of the Punjab cabinet and two Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MPs visited this village, giving an assurance of medical examination to all residents to map the prevalence of the diseases and provide them treatment. However, the visits of these VVIPs changed nothing for good in this village and the residents are living with recurring fear of getting infected with hepatitis C and cancer. Instead of providing the affected residents treatment or holding a hepatitis C and cancer detection camp in the past two months, on World Cancer Day today the health department organised a camp to create awareness about the diseases, said Gurtej Singh, a resident of Mari Mustafa. Besides two deaths due to cancer in his family, there are four other members suffering with Hepatitis C in Gurtej’s family. Dr Amar Singh Azad, a social activist and a senior pediatrician, said the Health Department discontinued its survey in Mari Mustafa village after finding out that a large number of people in this village were infected with hepatitis C (HCV) and cancer. After over 60 persons died of cancer and HCV last year, the Health Department started a large-scale household survey in the village that has a population of 11,000 in the first week of December last year. In the first round of the survey, 46 of the 297 persons tested were found to be infected. Finding that there was wide prevalence of the diseases, the department reportedly discontinued further testing. Dr Gurmail Singh, Senior Medical Officer (SMO) in the Mari Mustafa area, said they had stopped testing as residents feared their reputation would be tarnished and they would not be able to marry their children. As the first round of health check-up put forth a frightening spectacle of hepatitis C and cancer in the village, the health department discontinued further testing as it is not only Mari Mustafa but prevalence of the disease is more or less same in over 100 villages near Baghapurana subdivision of Moga, said Dr Azad."
