A. SITUATION ANALYSIS
Description of the disaster
Rainfall and widespread flooding due to the southwest monsoon continue to affect several states of India. The extended monsoon has left a trail of devastation and the death toll has reached more than 1,600 across 14 states.

An assessment made by the disaster management division of the Union Home Ministry indicates that over 2.2 million people have been evacuated so far and 8,700 relief camps set up across these states to provide temporary shelter to the displaced population2 .
As incessant monsoon rains wreak havoc across parts of India, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have been reeling under floods recently.  More than 100 people have died since 27 September following incessant rains3. The extended southwest monsoon over the Indian subcontinent has not only caused devastation in several places in the country but has also broken some old records and set new ones. In the current monsoon season, India receives highest ever rainfall recorded in the last 25 years, and with Mumbai breaking the 61-year record.
In Maharashtra, the monsoon has brought copious rains with its late onslaught. Mumbai has received 3,669.6 mm rainfall so far this season - the highest in 61 years - as against its normal quota of 2,350 mm. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted rain and thunder showers at many places in eastern Uttar Pradesh and heavy rain at isolated places over the western region on early October. In Ballia, authorities had to shift about 900 prisoners to other jails after flood waters entered the barracks of the district jail located near the Ganga River. The weather department has forecasted a long-delayed withdrawal of Monsoon and more rains for Bihar, including capital Patna where several areas still remain submerged, and food and relief material are being air dropped. In Patna, normal life was thrown out of gear, with several schools shut, roads inundated, and many shops, hospitals and houses submerged in knee deep waters.
More than 4,000 people, including women and children, were rescued from the flood-affected areas of Patna on Monday, 30 September as per NDRF report. The force said it has deployed five teams, with about 45 personnel in each, to conduct rescue and relief works in the city. An Indian Air Force helicopter commenced air-dropping of food and other relief materials to people living in low-lying areas where water level is said to be several feet high.
Rain bearing winds remain active over several parts of the country. Rainfall received so far is 10 per cent more than the normal, which is highest in the last 25 years. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified it 'above normal'.  The following table summarized the impact of floods in states where the DREF operation is involved.
The retreating monsoon season has caused havoc and destruction in many parts of the affected states. As of 30 September, the situation remains critical in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh as compared to the other affected states5.",https://reliefweb.int/node/3354153,2019-10-18

According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), as on August 24th, 417 people have died and over 54.11 lakh people were affected,12.47 lakh of whom had to seek shelter in 5,645 relief camps.
Indian Red Cross Society National Headquarters and state branches of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Chandigarh, Odisha, Haryana, Punjab, Bihar, West Bengal and Andaman Nicobar among others, have organised and sent relief in form of donations and material valued to Kerala State Red Cross branch.
Thousands of volunteers have been engaged in the relief efforts across Kerala, which include trained disaster response volunteers, Junior and Youth Red Cross members and others who are participating in rescue, packing and distribution of food items, tents and family packs containing tarpaulins, clothes, mosquito nets, hygiene kits, kitchen sets, buckets, solar lanterns etc. to the affected people. When the flood water was high and had cut off large areas, Airbus Foundation and IRCS partnered to reach the most isolated parts to provide relief materials to those in need.
Since the onset of the disaster, the Indian Red Cross response had reached over 1.5 lakh people as on August 24th 2018. The outreach has been growing since then as the teams have been focusing on the most isolated pockets.
Three large water purification units have also been placed at the services of the branch to provide safe drinking water to the affected population. Each unit has the capacity to supply 700 liters of drinking water per hour. Chlorine, bleaching powder, lime, and alum are being locally sourced and being used to purify water and are also being used as a disinfectant.
Since the flood water have started receding, the IRCS volunteers have started providing support and awareness on hygiene and sanitation, cleaning of houses and surroundings. As wells are a major source of water for daily use, disinfecting and cleaning them, a team of volunteers from Sri Lanka Red Cross is in Kerala to train volunteers to take up well cleaning on a large scale.
The Indian Red Cross, with the support of various members of Red Cross movement and others, is rolling out a detailed plan to provide mid and long-term recovery of the most vulnerable populations in the most vulnerable districts. Beneficiary and distribution data are being collected by volunteers using the Online Data Kits to ensure an optimal screening of needs and follow-ups during the recovery phase.

At least five of these flood-affected states have been placed on high risk on two other hazards—cyclone and heat wave
West Bengal has the highest risk of Cyclone, followed by Odisha, Andhra, Gujarat and Kerala
At least 100 cyclone prone districts have been studied for the purpose

NEW DELHI: Monsoon has just set in and more than 30 people have already died in floods in North East, 20 of them in Assam alone with over half a million marooned. But an assessment by the Union home ministry, which has worked out a Flood Vulnerability Index in its ongoing study on disaster risk reduction, has listed Punjab as the most vulnerable state and Gujarat facing as much risk as Assam.
Among the top 10 most vulnerable states, Punjab is followed by West Bengal, Bihar, UP, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Kerala, Assam, Gujarat and Odisha, in that order. These findings are based on data collected by the Centre on actual areas flooded since 1950.
However, the study points out that if the flood data taken for a period during 1980 and 2016, Assam and Bihar would probably rank higher than Punjab and West Bengal. In fact, last year, Bihar disaster management authorities had reported more than 500 deaths due to floods. The construction of dams in Indo-gangetic rivers have somewhat mitigated the hazards in recent decades, the study points out.
At least five of these flood-affected states have been placed on high risk on two other hazards—cyclone and heat wave. West Bengal has the highest risk of Cyclone, followed by Odisha, Andhra, Gujarat and Kerala. At least 100 cyclone prone districts have been studied for the purpose.
Odisha, UP, Andhra, West Bengal, Bihar and Punjab are also among the top 10 states facing the highest risk of heat wave deaths in the country.
A working paper prepared by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) recently found India vulnerable to more than 30 different types of disasters. In 2015 and 2016, more than 1,100 people reported killed in disasters and over 350 million affected across the country. The damages to properties in these two years alone have been estimated at over $4.4 billion.
A report from the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) had earlier said that between 2005 and 2014, at least 167 disasters struck India causing damages of more than $47 billion in properties, ranking the nation among the top four countries in the world with highest number of reported disasters.
The Flood Vulnerability Index has been prepared based on parameters such as areas actually flooded during 1950 to 2016, areas vulnerable to flood and metropolitan and large cities that fall in flood prone areas. On a scale of 10, Punjab has been assessed as facing the highest flood hazard risk of 6.67, followed by West Bengal 6.43, Bihar 6, UP 4.76, Andhra Pradesh 4.49, Haryana 4.12, Kerala 3.88, Assam 3.84, Gujarat 3.38 and Odisha 2.73.
Though Punjab, Haryana, UP and West Bengal had maximum floods in earlier decades, the current trend indicates flood incidents have increased in magnitude in Assam and Bihar in recent years.
The NDMA is currently working on a National Disaster Database that will capture nationwide losses of properties and lives occurring due to disasters and will ensure that states compulsorily report and feed all losses real time into the dynamic platform. This may also help the Centre in deciding the quantum of future investments in critical infrastructure depending on the performance of states in disaster risk reduction.",https://reliefweb.int/node/2664929,2018-06-21
Weather woes continue in various parts of country,15 Jun 2018,"
Weather woes continue to impact life in various parts of the country. While heavy rains have wreaked  havoc in some areas, a blanket of dust continues to prevail over the national capital region, further worsening the air quality.
In Kerala, at least 16 people have been killed in rain related incidents in the past one week. Heavy rains also led to a landslide in Kozhikode killing at least 8 people. NDRF teams were deployed for rescue operations and for locating those missing. Rains have led to floods and landslides in several parts of the state, Northern Kerala in particular.
In the north east, floods caused by heavy rains have thrown life out of gear in several parts. Assam, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura are worst affected.
In Assam, thousands of people have been affected due to heavy rains in the past 48 hours, Rains have also disrupted train services due to landslides. NDRF and SDRF teams have been deployed.
In Tripura, the flood situation deteriorated with the rain-fed Khowai river inundating fresh areas rendering thousands homeless and damaging roads and crops. Administration has shifted those affected to elief camps. Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Deb undertook an aerial survey of the flood hit areas. Additional NDRF teams have been posted in the state to expedite rescue operations.
In Manipur, with the rain easing off, flood situation has slightly improved in capital Imphal, however, it continues to be grim in the outskirts of the city. In Thoubal and Imphal West districts, flood situation is still worrying.
With thousands of houses damaged, several thousand people have been moved out of the area and provided shelter at relief camps. Given the seriousness of the situation, state government had declared school holidays on 14 and 15 June.
In Uttarakhand, several parts of the state also received rainfall. An alert was issued in the state for 14th and 15th June.
The Delhi NCR region continues to remain enveloped in a blanket of dust. Met department has said that dust storms emerging from Rajasthan were the reason being the dust cover in Delhi NCR and adjoining areas. Delhi's air quality remained severe for the fourth consecutive day on Friday, even as authorities expressed hope that the condition would improve with strong winds expected to clear the stagnant air.
Government and the met department have said that Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh are expected to receive rains in the next 24 hours and they would improve the situation.
As the national capital region struggled with severe dust pollution, Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal had on Thursday ordered stoppage of all civil construction activities across the city till Sunday.

"India: After floods, comes drought: 235 districts face monsoon deficit of 20% or more",14 Sep 2017,"
Amit Bhattacharya | TNN | Updated: Sep 14, 2017, 08:30 IST
HIGHLIGHTS

The monsoon deficit in west UP stands at 37%, highest for any subdivision in the country.
IMD believes the 2nd half of Sept could bring better rains in central India.
Situation in northwest may not change much, there are indications that central India may get some rain in the next couple of weeks.

NEW DELHI: Around 235 districts across the country face the prospect of drought this year as the monsoon appears headed for a below-normal performance, with the season's deficit currently at 6.2% of normal.
These districts, accounting for 37% of India's 630 districts for which rain data is available, have monsoon shortfall of at least 20%, with nine show acute deficits of 60% or more, data from the India Meteorological Department reveals.
A majority of the distress districts lie in the hinterland, in a swathe running through Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Vidarbha. UP, Haryana and MP are the hardest hit states, showing rain deficits of 31%, 28% and 25%, respectively.
The deficits have grown gradually since the end of July, when the monsoon started failing in central and north India. The first two months of the season, June and July, ended with a countrywide rain surplus of 2.5%. Monsoon's performance since August 1 has been a dismal 17% below normal (till September 12), with good rainfall being mainly restricted to south and northeast India. ""A number of factors worked against the monsoon since July-end. There have hardly been low-pressure circulations since then and conditions in the Indian and Pacific oceans have been unfavourable,"" said D Sivananda Pai, head of IMD's long range monsoon forecasts.
IMD had forecast normal monsoon this year at 96% of the long period average, which it updated to 98% in June.
Poor distribution of rainfall has added to the distress. As many as 110 districts have had excess or 'large excess' (over 60% of normal) rainfall. In addition, heavy rain spells in Gujarat, Rajasthan and catchment areas in the Himalayas (particularly in Nepal) caused the worst floods in the country in 10 years.
Ironically, states such as UP have seen both flood fury as well as the prospect of drought. The monsoon deficit in west UP stands at 37%, highest for any subdivision in the country. Of the state's 72 districts, rainfall has been deficient in 48. Out of these, five districts — Agra, Hamirpur, Mahamayanagar, Amethi and Kushinagar — face acute shortfall of 60% or more.
This combination of poor rains and floods is likely to hit kharif output, although data till September 8 reveals that the sowing area this year is only marginally less than last year's, with the biggest drops seen in oilseeds, pulses and jute. Several state governments have reportedly started drought exercises.
Poor rains have also affected water storage levels, important for winter crops. According to the Central Water Commission data, live storage at 91 important reservoirs in the country was at 58% of capacity on September 8, the lowest in five years for which data was available. It was lower than the corresponding period during the drought years of 2014 (74%) and 2015 (59%), and significantly below the 10-year average of 69%.
IMD believes the second half of September could bring better rains in central India. ""While the situation in northwest is not likely to change too much, there are indications that central India may get some rain in the next couple of weeks. Monsoon isn't likely to start withdrawing in the next few days,"" Pai said.",https://reliefweb.int/node/2218514,2017-09-14

"Statement on ‘Situation arising out of recent floods in various parts of the country, particularly in Assam’",27 Jul 2017,"
Following is the text of statement made in Rajya Sabha today by Minister of State for Home Affairs, Shri Kiren Rijiju on ‘Situation arising out of recent floods in various parts of the country, particularly in Assam’:
“India receives heavy rainfall from June to September every year during the South West (SW) Monsoon Season. The rainfall during this period accounts for about 70-90 % of the total annual rainfall over India. As a consequence of this rainfall, flooding of rivers is a natural weather phenomenon. This year monsoon set in over Kerala on 30th May, the monsoon has already covered entire country by 19th July 2017. In terms of area wise distribution, 89% of the area in the country received excess/ normal rainfall and 11% of the area received deficient rainfall till date.
Over 40 Million hectares’ land of the country is prone to floods and river erosion. The flood prone regions of India are the Himalayan Rivers Basin (Kosi and Damodar Rivers in particular), the North Western River Basin (Jhelum, Ravi, Sutlej and Beas Rivers) and the central and Peninsular River Basin (Narmada, Chambal, Godavari, Krishna and Cauvery River).
During the current South West monsoon season, various parts of the States of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and West Bengal reported to have been affected by heavy rains / flash floods / and rain oriented calamities of varying degrees. As per the information of damage received from these States 508 persons have lost their lives, 24,811 cattle heads have perished, 63,215 houses/ huts have been damaged and about 2.8 lakh hectares of crop area have been reported affected due to heavy rains/ flood/ landslides etc..
Primary responsibility to deal with natural calamities rest with the State Government concerned. The Central Government supplements the efforts of the State Governments by providing financial and logistics support to effectively deal with such exigent situations. The concerned State Governments have been taking necessary relief, preparedness/ preventive measures, which inter-alia includes distribution of relief, evacuation and shifting of the people to safer places, setting up of multipurpose relief shelters/ camps, providing Governments have also taken necessary health and hygiene measures to prevent outbreak of any epidemic during floods/ post flood calamity period. State authorities are monitoring rainfall, water level of the rivers/ dams in coordination with the IMD and CWC as well as issuing weather advisories to all vulnerable districts.
With regard to Assam, there are 2 major rivers system (viz; Brahmaputra valley and Barak valley) in the State which causes floods. The State faces acute flood problem in the flood plains of the river Brahmaputra and Barak and other smaller river sub-basins. Assam has faced two waves of floods till 19th July 2017 affecting 29 districts out of 33 districts, resulting in loss of human lives, livestock and large scale damage to the dwelling houses. The State Government is providing necessary relief assistance affected people in the State. As per information received from the State Government of Assam, about 59430.45 quintal rice, 11142.18 quintal dal, 3541.71 quintal salt, 37249.89 liters M. Oil and 58092 numbers of tarpaulins etc. have been provided to the affected people in different districts of Assam. The State Government has mentioned that 1160 relief camps (357 relief camps + 803 relief distribution center) have been opened and 1,31,416 inmates are housed in these camps, so far. However, at present the situation is under control in the State. The State Government is closely monitoring rescue & relief operations in the districts to deal with any eventuality. The Ministry of Home Affairs is also keeping constant round the clock watch on the situation in the country including Assam.
In order to assess the loss of immediate nature, upon receipt interim memorandum an Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) was constituted on 21st July 2017. The Inter-Ministerial Central Team, in consultation with the State Government, are visiting the affected areas of the State, from 25-28th July 2017 for on the spot assessment of damages of immediate and temporary nature. Further, action would be taken in the matter, in accordance with the established procedure.
To ensure effective preparedness, MHA conducted annual meeting of Relief Commissioners/ Secretaries, Department of Disaster Management of State / UTs on 17 May 2017 to review the status of preparedness and to discuss other disaster management related issues. The representatives of various Central Ministries/ Organizations rendering Emergency Support Functions also participated in the meeting. During the conference the emphasis was laid on close coordination with forecasting agencies such as Central Water Commission (CWC), India Metrological Department (IMD), GSI and INCOIS.
As stated earlier, the State Governments concerned are primarily responsible for undertaking necessary rescue, relief and preventive measures in the wake of natural calamities. Apart from providing logistics support, the Government of India supplements the efforts of the State Governments by extending financial assistance through State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) and National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) as per the laid down procedure. An amount of Rs. 9382.80 crore has been allocated as central share to all the States in their SDRF accounts for the year 2017-18. An amount of Rs. 3387.15 crore has so far been released, as the installment of Central share of SDRF for the year 2017-18 to 21 States. In addition, financial assistance from NDRF amounting to Rs. 1555.84 crore has been provided during 2017-18, so far, to different States which were affected by calamities of severe nature. In addition to regular schemes of crops damage, the farmers are also entitled for compensation under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna of the Ministry of Agriculture, which is being implemented by the State Government.
MHA have deployed about 88 specialized teams of NDRF in 26 States and UTs with 304 boats another necessary search and rescue equipment. Based on vulnerability profile of different regions of the country, NDRF teams have been presently stationed/ deployed at 12 Bn HQ viz; Guwahati (Assam), Haringhata (West Bengal), Mundali (Odisha), Arakkonam (Tamil Nadu), Pune (Maharashtra), Vadodra (Gujarat), Bhatinda (Punjab), Ghaziabad (Uttar Pradesh), Bihta (Bihar), Vijayawada (Andhra Pradesh), Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh) and Doimukh (Arunachal Pradesh). Besides, pre-positioning of the NDRF teams has already been done at 31 different locations in the country depending on the vulnerability profile of the area. In addition, NDRF teams also assist to the State administration in distribution of essential relief material and provide medical support to affected people at the time of emergency. NDRF also conducts mock drills along with the relevant departments and State agencies in the country for effective management of floods, response and rescue operations.

Taking a Holistic Approach to Water Management,22 Mar 2017,"
STORY HIGHLIGHTS

Two-thirds of India is prone to droughts and one-eight is susceptible to floods.
India’s complex hydrology calls for a holistic approach.
The two hydrology projects have helped several communities in vulnerable areas to plan in advance and build resilience against the uncertainties of climate change.

Down the ages, droughts and floods have stalked the vast Indian landmass. Often, these specters go hand in hand, playing out their macabre spectacle in rapid succession. For, many a time, after a long scorching summer parches the land, dark monsoon clouds roll in from the sea, and the heavens disgorge their largesse with an unrelenting fury.
Year in year out, droughts and floods take an unforgiving toll. Two-thirds of India is prone to droughts and one-eight is susceptible to floods. Surging flood waters afflict some 32 million people each year, robbing the economy of anything between Rs 6000 crore and Rs 12,000 crores. Drought affects a further 150 million people.
Although India as a whole is not a water scarce country, its water is unevenly distributed across both seasons and regions. Some areas have too much water while others have too little. And, not all the water is available when it is needed most.
Add to this the increasing intensity of droughts and floods, as well as a rapidly growing population, and the impacts of these twin specters is becoming larger by the day.
With half of India’s annual precipitation falling in just 15 rain-soaked days, droughts and floods are likely to remain a fact of life in the country,” explains Anju Gaur, senior water specialist at the World Bank in New Delhi. “The only way out is to fundamentally change the way we manage things.”
It’s not so much a water crisis as a water management crisis
Clearly, India’s complex hydrology calls for a holistic approach. For a start, floods are not caused by heavy rains alone. The situation is often compounded by weak water management systems, faulty urban design, or rivers that have been unduly constrained by bunds and encroachments.
Quite often, floods are caused by the sudden release of water from reservoirs. “Take the floods in Bihar in 2016, in Odisha in 2011, or the floods in the Krishna river in Andhra Pradesh in 1998 that affected more than 2 million people,” says Gaur. “Most of these occurred in late August or September, when the reservoirs were full. When more rain fell, reservoir operators got just a few hours to release the excess water to prevent a breach, or else there would have been even more devastation downstream.”
The main issue is that, until now, reservoir operators did not have the technological tools to help them take crucial decisions. Rather, they were required to abide by strict schedules for the release of water that were often laid down in colonial times.
If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it
Now, for the first time in India, two hydrology projects – Hydrology I (1995-2003) and Hydrology II (2006-2014) – supported by the World Bank, have introduced new systems and technology that give reservoir managers an accurate picture of the water situation unfolding in their region.
These systems have also laid the foundation for a comprehensive knowledge base that can improve the overall management of water resources in the country. “Reliable data is a must for making better decisions,” says Gaur. “This is especially important when you are dealing with such large volumes of water, as even small mistakes can have huge consequences.”
""With half of India’s annual precipitation falling in just 15 rain-soaked days, droughts and floods are likely to remain a fact of life in the country. The only way out is to fundamentally change the way we manage things."" - Anju Gaur, Senior Water Specialist at the World Bank
Making information travel faster than flood water
The first project – Hydrology 1 – focused on the peninsular states, where most rivers are straddled by a series of reservoirs (the Western Ghats in Maharashtra alone are dotted with more than 1,800 reservoirs and barrages of both large and medium sizes). The second project extended its reach to cover the two water-rich northern states of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh.
To better manage water flows from these reservoirs, new systems now monitor all the important aspects of the hydro-meteorological cycle. Measurement begins high up in the catchments of rivers, where digital gauges measure how much rain or snow has fallen, how rapidly the snow is melting, the speed with which the water is flowing, how much silt has built up, how much water will reach the reservoir, how soon it will do so, and so on. Sensors in the field instantly transmit this information to data centres through satellite or mobile phone technology, enabling managers to form a clear picture of the water situation unfolding in their region.
While these systems have been installed across peninsular India, the Bhakra Beas and the Krishna-Bhima systems have gone a step further. They now have a modelling tool that helps them predict water flows into their reservoirs three days in advance. This means that the lead time for planning the release of water from these reservoirs has shot up from just hours to days.
“Earlier it took lots of manpower and at least 24 hours to process this information from the field. Not surprisingly, engineers often ended up doing a post-mortem of a flood rather than pre-empting one,” recalls Gaur. Now, whenever it rains heavily, reservoir managers can start releasing water slowly so that the reservoirs remain full while there is no risk to dam safety and no damage downstream.
Advance information is particularly important for the shorter peninsular rivers where it barely takes a few hours for the water to travel from the catchment to the reservoir. “Sangli town in Maharashtra, for instance, used to have flash floods whenever there was a sudden release of water from the Koyna dam upstream,” Gaur adds. “Now this no longer happens.”
These reservoir management systems, which cost a total of Rs 30 crores, have helped avert flood damages of over Rs. 238 crores. And, the results are there for all to see. In 2010, for instance, Punjab, a highly flood-prone state, experienced some of the worst floods in its history, taking a huge toll on life and property. But, in 2013, when the rivers were in similar spate, no floods took place and there was no damage. This is not to say that floods will no longer happen, explains Gaur. If the rains are unduly heavy, floods may well take place, but advance warning can certainly help save lives.
These systems can also help alleviate the harshest impact of droughts. “A full reservoir is the best cushion against a drought in the dry season,” says Gaur. “Thanks to these systems, 2015 was the first time that all the Krishna basin reservoirs in Maharashtra were full by the end of the monsoon.”
Mapping groundwater
With groundwater levels depleting at an alarming rate, the second project – Hydrology 2 – used advanced geophysical techniques with helicopter-borne instruments to pilot the mapping of aquifers in five states – Rajasthan, Bihar, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.
The technology is not only much faster and more accurate than other methods, but is also much cheaper. “Groundwater modeling is an extremely complex subject,” explains Gaur. “Once the mapping is complete, we will get a much clearer picture of the groundwater resources in a region. It will also help in designing the best methods to recharge and manage this precious resource.”
Closer magnification can also throw up a host of new issues. “Until now our information was on a scale of 1:250,000. Once it is reduced to 1:50,000 or better, who knows what will come to light?” Gaur adds.
Since water quality has emerged as another critical issue, the second project also helped states identify where the quality of groundwater has been affected by fluorides, nitrates, and other contaminants.
Monitoring water quality
The second hydrology project also piloted water quality monitoring in surface water sources. Thirteen real-time water quality monitoring stations were set up on the Ganga and Yamuna rivers. These stations proved extremely useful in maintaining water quality during the Kumbh Mela in 2013 when millions of people took the ritual dip in the holy river.
Real time readings from these stations helped determine when water needed to be released upstream on critical bathing days, and when it needed treatment. Today, these stations continue to play their role on both these rivers, especially upstream and downstream of the capital, Delhi. Given the usefulness of these stations, 111 more such stations are being planned along the main Ganga river.
Managing competing demands for water
The systems and technology introduced under the two hydrology projects have much broader applications too. “If we are to manage our exceedingly complex web of water resources effectively, we need to know how much water the country has, when it has it, and where it has it,” clarifies Gaur. “Without accurate data on the existing water situation in the country, we are really shooting in the dark.”
Water data can also be a critical input in making development decisions. In Pune, for example, a planned tunnel between two reservoirs to improve the city’s water supply was abandoned for a simpler, better and cheaper solution.
Accurate water data also provides a scientific basis on which to manage competing demands for river water, especially as disputes are often sparked by the lack of correct information. “Accurate data can not only guide the sharing of river waters but also be used to better manage the fragile ecology of a river basin, help with better water resources planning and allocation during lean periods, design flood protection works, and so on,” explains Chabungbam Rajagopal Singh, water resources management specialist at the World Bank in New Delhi.
A third Hydrology project, supported by the World Bank, will now expand the water resources monitoring system to cover the entire country, including the Indus, Ganga, and Brahmaputra-Barak river basins. Under this project, the Ministry of Water Resources will provide states with a grant to collect water data for each river, stream and reservoir in their territory.
The importance of sharing water data
“Importantly, we need to move beyond mere data collection to using it more effectively. For this, the willingness of organizations to open up their data and make it transparent will be the key, explains Gaur. In addition, water resources institutions will need to be brought under one umbrella with one single agency to manage both ground and surface water. Engineers and scientists will also need to evolve into water managers and take a river basin-wide approach to manage all water resources in an integrated manner. More importantly, riparian states and other stakeholders will need to come together to plan the allocation of river water during a dry year, a wet year and a year of normal rainfall, while being ready for climate change.
“Overall, the real and tangible benefits of the systems established under the two Hydrology projects include people whose lives, homes, and crops are saved due to improved flood forecasting, farmers who benefit from improved irrigation supplies, and children who do not fall ill or worse from drinking contaminated water,” said Halla Maher Qaddumi, senior water economist at the World Bank in New Delhi. “Over time, it is hoped that accurate water data will also help reduce conflict between people and states over shared water resources.”
Leaders in Transparency
· The Central Water Commission has created a state of the art platform that publicly shares national level water data online.
· Maharashtra shares real time water information together with streamflow forecasts, and audits water use by various sectors for each major/ medium reservoir. This is published annually on the web.
· Others states too are devising interim arrangements to display water information and joining the central platform on water resources information, while still others are yet to follow.
· Transparency is equally important for groundwater too. For, unlike surface water bodies which are managed by the government, the management of groundwater lies primarily in the hands of the people. Andhra Pradesh has been the first off the block in this, posting monthly bulletins and real time information on the groundwater situation on the Chief Minister’s web portal.
· Gujarat too is conducting an indepth analysis of the groundwater situation, particularly around the cities, to meet growing urban demand.
· Going forward both the centre and states will need to join hands to develop a sound national water resources information system and agree to make it accessible.",https://reliefweb.int/node/1960219,2017-03-22

"ACT Preliminary Appeal: Flooding in Tamil Nadu, South India – IND152 Appeal Target: US$ 657,278",15 Dec 2015,"
I. NARRATIVE SUMMARY
DETAILS OF THE EMERGENCY
A climatic low pressure area which lay centred over coastal Tamil Nadu unleashed heavy showers ina continuous spree in Tamil Nadu during this Northeast Monsoon from the first week of November and has only abated on the 4th of December. So far there has been three spells of intensive rainfall. The first intensive spell of rainfall was from 8th and 9th November, followed by intensive rains again on 15th, 16th and 17th November. The first spell witnessed intensive flooding in Cuddalore where most of the water bodies were full and the associated breaching affected the community’s life damaging house, infrastructure, etc. During the first spell the city of Chennai experienced minor flooding to moderate flooding. The second spell saw Chennai going out of gear as many settlements in Chennai were flooded. The impacts of this spell stretched beyond Chennai to adjoining district to Chennai namely Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur, though the impacts in Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur was less compared to Chennai. The third spell which is still on going has been more intensive than the first two spells and the impacts has exacerbated the flooding severely. This time Chennai city was badly hit with nonstop rains, in some areas the flood water level was almost six feet high. Entire neighbourhoods have been flooded, homes, shops and other establishments deluged. People have been marooned in the upper floors of homes.. Many had to remain inside their houses without electricity as the whole city was flooded. People have been rescued and evacuated from the flooded areas by boats. The army airdropped food and water packets to the stranded families. The attributing reason for the same has been due to the heavy downpour on one side and the low level of water absorbtion capacity in view of the continuous rains since November first week. The process has completely thrown out of gear the normal life of people in many districts in Tamil Nadu. So far nearly 400 people have died and over 1.8 million people have been displaced.
Non-stop torrential rains since Monday night (30.11.2015) pounded several parts of Chennai and north Tamil Nadu triggering a deluge completely disrupting normal life as army was deployed today in two suburban areas to undertake rescue on a war footing.The flood situation continues to remain grim in the city and several parts of Tamil Nadu. The city still remains virtually cut off from the rest of the country with air, rail and road transport services. According to reports, Chennai faces acute shortage of necessary items while the price of food grains sky rocket due to shortage. Residents have complained about lack of medicines, milk, potable water and vegetables.
Meanwhile, Indian naval ship INS Airavat has reached Chennai with relief materials. The government has deployed 1200 NDRF personnel, 100 boats and 200 divers to rescue stranded people in flood-hit areas. 40 army teams, 6 navy teams with 12 boats and several relief teams have been deployed in Chennai to intensify rescue and relief operations. In several places, power supply and communication lines are down, adding to the misery. Speaking to India Today Television, National Disaster Response Force Director General O P Singh said 5 teams from Patna and Guwahati will soon leave for Chennai while 5 teams from Punjab have already reached Chennai. Another 5 teams from Pune are all set to leave for Chennai.
Some 164,000 people have been housed in 460 camps in Chennai, Cuddalore, Thiruvallur and Kanchipuram districts while thousands have also been shifted to others' houses after water entered theirs. At least 269 people have been killed to due to rain and flood related incidents in Tamil Nadu where thousands have become homeless. Keeping in view the situation, Chief MinisterJ. Jayalalithaa has urged Prime Minister NarendraModi to declare the unprecedented crisis a national disaster. Chennai has suffered unprecedented destruction, with water overflowing from rivers and reservoirs seeping into scores of apartments and houses, markets, shopping malls, offices and educational institutions, unsettling life like never before. The floods have also killed 54 in neighboring Andhra Pradesh and two in Pondicherry.
A green body on Friday said that the floods in Chennai are an impact of climate change and the ""unprecedented deluge"" that the city has witnessed is a reminder of increasing frequency of such freak weather events across the Indian subcontinent. The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said that Chennai could have fared better if it had protected and preserved its natural water bodies and drainage channels.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on last Thursday (3.11.2015) flew to Chennai to take stock of the flood situation. After an aerial survey, he met with Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa and announced Rs.1,000crore (US$ 151,515,151.52) for Tamil Nadu flood relief. He said this is in addition to the Rs. 940 crore (US$ 142,424,242.42) which were released by the Centre earlier. The floods have left over 269 dead in Tamil Nadu and 54 in Andhra Pradesh, said Home Minister Rajnath Singh in LokSabha. He described the situation as ""alarming”. At the parliamentary meet, the Centre described the situation in Chennai as ""worrisome"". Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa Friday conducted an aerial survey of the flood-hit areas in Chennai and sururbs on Thursday. The India Meterlogical Department (IMD) has
predicted heavy rains for the next three days in Tamil Nadu. The Airports Authority of India on Wednesday announced that operations at the Chennai airport will be shut till December 7 due to water logging on the runway. Many trains have been cancelled or diverted.",https://reliefweb.int/node/1307226,2015-12-15

The progress of the monsoon through the season is bringing joy mixed with sorrow in different parts of the country. Heavy rains have been wreaking havoc in the hilly regions of the country as well as the north east causing loss of life and property. The met department has issued warnings for the coming week.
However, there is good news for farmers. North-West India is no longer in the deficit but rainfall is now 12% above normal. The total sown area as now, as per reports received from States, stands at 563.35 lakh hectare as compared to 346.34 lakh hectare at this time last year. This is over 61 % more than last year at this date.
Four persons were killed in a series of cloudbursts that struck near Sonamarg, a place en route to the Amarnath Yatra, forcing temporary suspension of the pilgrimage. Cause of cloudburst in the valley is due to heavy downpour on Thursday evening. Natural calamity has damaged many roads and houses. According to Srinagar police, cloudburst occurred in Kullan and Gagangir village.
There is a temporary suspension of Amarnath yatra from Baltal and Pahalgam routes. Efforts are made to remove the debris that has blocked the road leading to Baltal base camp. Army has stepped in to help Jammu and Kashmir government to cope with the nature's fury. The Srinagar-Leh highway was closed after the cloud burst. Army mounted has a relief operation to clear the national highway.
Two Spanish and two civil engineers were rescued by the Army from the affected area after the natural calamity. The Weatherman has forecast more rains over the next 24 hours across Kashmir.
In Assam around 174 villages in 4 districts are affected due to flood. Communication has disrupted in the affected areas. Brahamaputra, Nematighat and Jiya Barali river in Sonitpur district are above the danger mark.
In Uttarakhand too, due to heavy downpour, landslides occurred in many places. Dehradoon- Mussori road has damaged. Heavy rainfall in Haridwar resulted in waterlogging.
On Friday, Rainfall occurred in Delhi and NCR. Met dept has issued alert of heavy rainfall in the coming days. Punjab and Haryana witnessed heavy downpour since Thursday late evening. As result, the temperature has come down in these two states. Though rain has caused damage in many parts of the country but it is beneficial for kharif crop.

"Fresh tremors hit many states, toll climbs to 62",27 Apr 2015,"
NEW DELHI: Nepal and the impoverished Indian state of Bihar share a relationship of being united in grief and every natural disaster that strikes the small Himalayan country gives credence to a feeling that artificial boundaries cannot separate a deep link of seismic waves.
The death toll in India was revised to 62 on Sunday after the massive earthquake struck Nepal around Saturday noon. Fifty of them belonged to Bihar and 259 people were reported injured across the country. The death toll in neighbouring Nepal crossed 2,200.
A breach in the Kosi embankment near the Indo-Nepal border on 18 August 2008 made the river change its course and inundate areas which hadn't experienced floods in many decades. The flood affected over 2.3 million people in the northern part of Bihar.
Pleasure and its pursuit are private and divisive while grief and sorrow binds human beings. So it's understandable that Bihar is the state that feels the pain more acutely than other parts of India.
Bihar CM Nitish Kumar said that the state government had decided to chip in with whatever it could provide to the earthquake victims in addition to the aid by the Centre. Kumar said, ""We share border with Nepal and the people of the two areas have been living together for ages which warrant us to provide humanitarian assistance at our level too.""
Fresh tremors were felt on Sunday in northern and eastern parts of India sparking panic. The tremors triggered by a 6.7-magnitude aftershock epicentred in Nepal were experienced in West Bengal, Bihar, Assam, Jharkhand, Odisha, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Chattisgarh and Delhi for over 30 seconds at 12:42pm.
The government announced Rs 6 lakh compensation to the relatives of those killed as Prime Minister Narendra Modi took stock of rescue and relief operations at a review meeting.
Out of 38 aftershocks emanating from the epicentre of the earthquake in Nepal since Saturday, eight have been felt in Bihar measuring between 5.5 and 6.9 on the Richter Scale, a MET official said.
West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee visited people in north Bengal affected by the quake and said that a rescue team is being sent to Nepal. An Indian army expedition team rescued over 61 climbers from Mount Everest and retrieved 19 bodies.
""19 dead bodies were retrieved and 61 injured persons were rescued by the Indian Army Expedition Team. The Medical Officer has treated a number of injured international mountaineers in addition to the 61 listed above and considerable medicines and rations have been distributed from own resources,"" an Army statement said.
The Sikh community did what is renowned for and said it will send 25,000 food packets to Kathmandu each day from Monday. They will also be making arrangements to prepare and distribute ""langar"" (community kitchen) in Nepal to provide relief to earthquake victims.",https://reliefweb.int/node/955971,2015-04-27
Help for Recovery after South Asia Floods,18 Nov 2014,"
By David Tereshchuk*
November 18, 2014—In September of this year, South Asia’s worst monsoon season in 50 years caused torrential flooding and landslides that killed hundreds of people in India and Pakistan, and displaced many thousands from their homes.
In India-administered Kashmir—a region that for decades has been disputed territory between the two countries, and where the rains were especially severe—at least 120 people died and 200,000 were left homeless.
The United Methodist Committee on Relief (UMCOR) is partnering with local and international humanitarian organizations that have extensive experience of the region and its challenges.
The partners include the India-based Church’s Auxiliary for Social Action (CASA) and, operating from the Pakistan side, the globally constituted Church World Service. In Pakistan, local Christian groups have been active in providing relief, and UMCOR is supporting them.
In addition, GlobalMedic, a health-oriented organization based in Canada and that has long been active in both Pakistan and India, is using its funding from UMCOR to carry out post-disaster water-purification across the affected areas.
Even after the rains eased up, Kashmir’s rivers continued to swell, bringing fresh floods downstream. Srinagar, Indian Kashmir’s largest city, was extensively damaged, with floodwaters running at a depth of 12 feet in many neighborhoods, often submerging entire homes.
As often occurs with flooding, contaminated water supplies became a pressing problem in the wake of the disaster. GlobalMedic has installed public weather-purification systems and is also providing hundreds of families with the tools to purify water in their own homes.
Meeting Food and Hygiene Needs
GlobalMedic became fully engaged on the Pakistan side, too, and, with UMCOR support, has provided “RainFresh” household water-purification units and educated entire communities in their use. Each unit distributed by GlobalMedic is designed to ensure clean, drinkable water for a family of seven for six months.
Also on the Pakistan side, UMCOR has supported the efforts of the Multan Diocese of the Church of Pakistan to meet desperate food and hygiene needs among residents in their district of the Punjab province. And the Christian movement Paigaam Ministries also has employed UMCOR funds to provide food, non-food items and water in Punjab’s Jhang district.
In the Bagh district of Pakistan’s Azad Kashmir territory, Church World Service is providing emergency food kits with the help of an UMCOR grant. The grant also covers CWS’s provision of essential practical goods such as jerry-cans, buckets, mosquito nets and sleeping mats.
Overcoming logistics obstacles
Meanwhile, on the Indian side, CASA has been providing help in the form of UMCOR-funded emergency food packages and non-food items such as blankets and groundsheets. CASA has managed to distribute these essential supplies among some 800 families despite the logistical difficulties created by the Kashmir Valley being so extensively submerged in floodwater.
“We are fortunate in having CASA as partners,” says the Rev. Jack Amick, UMCOR’s assistant general secretary for International Disaster Response. “They are not only locally based, with deep knowledge of the territory and the people, but they are also well-connected internationally.”
The recent flooding in Kashmir and beyond have brought humanitarian challenges to this politically contentious slice of South Asia, but UMCOR and its partners are advancing relief and recovery by putting the needs of badly hit populations first.
Your gift to International Disaster Response, Advance # 982450, will help South Asia flood survivors and other populations affected by catastrophe to start rebuilding their lives.",https://reliefweb.int/node/728766,2014-11-18
Emergency flood response continues,28 Oct 2014,"
As winter approaches, millions of people are still at risk more than a month after widespread flooding devastated communities in India and Pakistan.
In Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir, hundreds of villages were submerged during the floods. Ten villages now have access to safe drinking water, thanks to water filtration plants provided by Islamic Relief.
“The plant is like a blessing for all of us,” said Shafia, 35, who lives with her children in Nowgam village, where water sources have been contaminated by the flooding. “Now, I do not have to worry about drinking water anymore.”
We have also cleaned the sites around the ten water filtration plants, and are raising awareness of good hygiene practices as part of efforts to prevent the spread of disease. Around 10,000 people have benefitted so far.
Our emergency response will also include providing vital medicines and health services to families uprooted by the disaster. In addition, residents of around 20 flood-affected villages are to receive psychosocial support.
Communities in India hit by new flooding
Some 1.2 million people in Assam and Meghalaya have been hit by new flooding, which has destroyed nearly 34,000 homes and damaged infrastructure such as schools, health facilities and transport structures. Over 163,000 people are currently living in relief camps and other temporary shelters.
Essential relief for flood-affected families in Pakistan
In Pakistan, hundreds died and around 2.5 million people were affected as floodwaters destroyed homes, vital infrastructure, and livelihoods last month.
Islamic Relief’s emergency teams have been distributing essential relief items. In Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), more than 1,700 people benefitted from tents, plastic sheeting, and kitchen tents. In Punjab, we offered relief from the worry of finding food, by providing over 10,000 flood-affected families across four union councils with Qurbani meat.
The approaching winter threatens to increase the hardship faced by affected families, many of whom still lack adequate protection from the elements and essential supplies. Support our relief efforts: Donate to our India & Pakistan floods appeal today.",https://reliefweb.int/node/703828,2014-10-28
2 Patna doctors serve flood-hit in Kashmir,19 Oct 2014,"
Banjot Kaur Bhatia,TNN | Oct 19, 2014, 10.45 PM IST
PATNA: While help poured in from different corners of the world for the people of Jammu and Kashmir reeling under floods late last month, two Patna-based doctors also did their bit by offering medical help to people there.
Noted urologist Dr Satyajit Singh and public health activist Dr Shakeel were part of a12-member team of doctors that served the people of Pulwama and Srinagar under the banner of Indian Doctors for Peace and Development (IDPD). IDPD has experience of working in various disasters including Kosi floods. Other doctors of the team that went to the valley hailed from Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and Jammu. They served the flood victims of Srinagar and Pulwama from September 28 to October 3.
The team split itself among camps and apart from offering medical care, it distributed medicines, blankets, sweaters and other garments among the flood victims. ""Most of them were suffering from infectious diseases like diarrhoea, skin and allergic reactions and joint pains mainly due to staying in water for a long time,"" said Dr Satyajit, who is also national vice-president of IDPD. He added a large number of patients were suffering from anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.
IDPD secretary Dr Shakeel said the governance in the state to mitigate the pains of the victims was not up to the mark. ""Even after 20 days of floods, the foul smell of rotten bodies of animals had filled the atmosphere. This could have led to outbreak of epidemics,"" he said. Two main medical colleges of the state - Government Medical College and Hospital and JVC Medical College and Hospital, both at Srinagar - were reeling under water. The infrastructure of the hospital, including costly equipment, was destroyed. The entire wholesale market of medicines was completely submerged in water. The alternative arrangement of doctors and medicines was not in proportion to the amount required,"" said Dr Shakeel.
There was also huge shortage of doctors, because native doctors of Kashmir were themselves reeling under floods and hence not available for duty. Nonetheless, many voluntary organizations were working there, he said.",https://reliefweb.int/node/702341,2014-10-19

Migrant labourers trek mountainous highway to escape flood-hit Kashmir,13 Sep 2014,"
Sameer Arshad,TNN
JAMMU: Narinder Kumar (30), a Bihari mason, was working overtime when gushing waters menacingly flooded the construction site he was working at in Srinagar, forcing him and his fellow workers to take refuge on the top floor of a nearby house. They were trapped there for next three days without food and water.
With no help in sight, the workers left the locality on foot when the water levels receded and trekked all the way to Ramban along the closed Srinagar-Jammu national highway 150km away. The local authorities and the Army fed them at a camp hurriedly setup there before arranging for their travel to Udhampur en route to their home state.
Kumar is among an estimated 12,000 people, who have trekked to Ramban in sheer desperation as they received no help from administration, which was practically washed away in the flood waters that have killed over 200 people and marooned tens of thousands besides leaving as many homeless.
""We had some leftover bread that we shared among half-a-dozen people for three days. We thought we would starve to death and were left with no option but to leave on foot,"" said Kumar. He said residents along the way helped in whatever way they could help despite being in dire straits themselves. ""Some people offered us apples, while others whatever little they had.""
Another Bihari labourer Yudhvir Yadav said he was stuck close to the airport in Srinagar and rushed for free airlifting. But the security personnel posted there allegedly chased him away, forcing him to leave for Jammu on foot as well. ""We were marooned for two days before we reached the airport from where we were sent back,"" he said. ""At places we were offered lift. We have no money to go back to our state.""
Deputy commissioner Farooq Ahmad Shah said these people started reaching Ramban from Friday morning. ""We immediately set up a camp for them at Ramban general bus stand, where a kitchen was set up, "" he said. ""The army has set up a camp separately at Neera.""
A defence spokesman said they had to specially help them cross a 300m stretch of the highway washed away near Ramsu with the help of ropes.""
Official said most of the migrants' workers, who arrived in Ramban do odd jobs in Srinagar and belong to West Bengal, Bihar, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.
Television visuals showed long lines of migrants workers trekking along the lifeline, treacherous mountainous highway that remained closed for the ninth day on Saturday. The highway crisscrosses some of the highest peaks in the world and is the only surface route connecting Kashmir with the outside world.
Many migrant workers like a woman, who had arrived Ramban along with her two-year-old child on route to her native Malda in West Bengal, told the media she had her first meal in three days there.
Roshan Singh from Amritsar, who arrived in Ramban on Saturday, said the Army rescued him after five days from a trapped house in Srinagar. ""The Army evacuated us to a relief camp, where the situation was pathetic forcing us to trek to Ramban.""",https://reliefweb.int/node/691309,2014-09-13
India floods: Aid on the way to survivors of worst floods for 50 years,12 Sep 2014,"
Thousands of people in the flood-stricken Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir are to receive emergency aid from Tearfund after the area suffered its worst monsoon rains in 50 years.
Tearfund’s local partner, the Evangelical Fellowship of India Commission on Relief (EFICOR), will this week distribute food, including rice, wheat and pulses, to 500 of the most vulnerable families who’ve suffered as a result of flooding and landslides.
The food supplies will be enough to last 25 days, with warm clothes, hygiene kits, cooking utensils and plastic sheets for shelter also being supplied.
However flood damage is hampering communications and access. EFICOR, which has a track record of responding to natural disasters, such as the 2001 Gujarat earthquake and the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, is working closely with the Indian government and other humanitarian agencies at state and national level to get help to those who need it as quickly as possible.
Prince David, Tearfund’s Country Representative for India, said, ‘The monsoon rains this year have brought misery to millions of people. Although the waters are starting to recede, it will a long time before many of those affected can resume their normal lives. Through our partners, we are responding where the need is greatest.’
The disaster has so far claimed 220 lives in India and left a million people needing help. Thousands of villages have been inundated by the floods, with many people taking to their roofs to escape the fast-rising waters. Others are staying in temporary camps and temporary shelters.
Five days of rain have caused rivers to break their banks, widespread damage to roads, other infrastructure and crops. The floods have also brought devastation to parts of Pakistan where 230 people have died, with the state of Punjab badly affected, as well as Bangladesh and Nepal.

Epic floods in India and Pakistan,10 Sep 2014,"
Heavy monsoon rains have caused widespread flooding in Jammu and Kashmir in India and across the border in Punjab and Azad Jammu and Kashmir in Pakistan.
The Chenab and Jhelum rivers rose dramatically at the weekend, causing massive destruction, with smaller rivers also overflowing. Hundreds of villages have been submerged, forcing hundreds of thousands of people from their homes and leaving hundreds of people dead.
Aid efforts hampered as roads cut
In Jammu and Kashmir in India, Caritas India say the priorities are to provide shelter for those forced from their homes, clean drinking water and food, medicine and other aid like blankets and cooking equipment.
As many as 60 major and minor roads have been cut off and over 30 bridges washed away, hampering the relief and rescue operations.
Caritas India’s Prakash Singh has been to the city of Srinagar, one of the worst-hit areas.
“Conditions in Kashmir are very bad. Health facilities are all damaged, there is no water and no electricity,” he said. “I saw the valley filled with water, as high as 25 ft. I couldn’t move 500 m from the airport. Srinagar airport is the highest in India. If the flood has reached its boundaries, we can only imagine what is the condition of the people.”

Caritas India has had to set up a stand-by base for relief efforts in nearby Jammu until the roads open. Follow their relief efforts here.
Babita Alick, Team Leader for Disaster Management for Caritas India, said, “We are ready to move in with all our pre-positioned sanitation, food and water kits.
“Besides, basic essentials like drinking water, sanitation kits, clothes, family tents and bedding, we hope to send paramedics to assist people recover from one of the worst nightmares in a decade. Caritas can foresee a massive task ahead.”
Caritas Pakistan reaches survivors
In Punjab and Azad Jammu and Kashmir in Pakistan, hundreds of villages have been washed away, embankments broken, roads damaged and power lines downed. Flood water has ruined crops stretched across thousands of acres. Many people have lost their livestock.
Two Caritas Pakistan teams are in the field. They say thousands of families are in need of food and safe drinking water.
Caritas Pakistan is already providing ‘non-food’ kits to affected families in Lahore and Rawalpindi dioceses as it assesses how to respond further.",https://reliefweb.int/node/690316,2014-09-10
"J&K floods: Over 200 dead, 47,000 people rescued",10 Sep 2014,"
Sameer Arshad,TNN | Sep 10, 2014, 06.40 AM IST
JAMMU: The death toll from the floods in Jammu & Kashmir crossed 200 on Tuesday even as water receded in some parts with officials fearing the number of those killed could rise once the actual extent of damage becomes clearer.
Rescue work was impeded as large parts of the state remained cut off save by air. The damage to the Jammu & Kashmir national highway has been extensive, officials said, adding that large number of villages and towns remain without electricity and clean drinking water.
Armed forces and NDRF have so far saved 47,227 people flying 451 sorties and transporting 42,000 litres of water, 563 tonnes of relief material including seven tonnes of baby food. Altogether 61 aircraft and choppers have been pressed into service. Yet, there were complaints from relief camps of supplies failing to reach. The Forces have deployed over 1 lakh soldiers for rescue operations, equipped with 170 boats. Over 40 boats were airlifted from Rajasthan and Punjab on Tuesday with 10 medical teams.
""Army medical authorities have flown in two tonnes of medical stores capable of treating more than 7,000 patients from Kanpur,'' said defence spokesman S D Goswami. BSNL and around 5,700 personnel of Border Roads Organization are working to restore communication links, the absence of which is hitting operations. Landlines were restored near the Srinagar airport in a major relief to authorities.
Authorities also fear epidemics arising from contaminated drinking water.
AIR and Doordarshan stations near Jhelum, which has flooded several upscale areas in Srinagar, remained off air with their premises flooded along with key buildings including the civil secretariat, the high court and the police control room.
The radio station usefully ran a live helpline until it went off air Sunday . Homes of top police officers, bureaucrats and ministers were submerged, including flood control minister Sham Lal Sharma's residence. Unconfirmed reports said the missing include some ministers. Unverifiable reports have said over 2,000 villages remain submerged. Overflowing waters from the lake have flooded areas around the Hazratbal shrine and the National Institute of Technology . Many people said rescuers had failed to reached them. The water level in the Dal Lake was rising steadily as Jhelum's flow was diverted into it.
A news agency quoted a Disaster Response Force official saying ""the damage is shocking'' with people stranded on rooftops for days. An official said salvage operations were delayed in Kashmir as flood alerts weren't issued on time. He said: ""We were caught off guard because there wasn't a single warning by the weather office.""",https://reliefweb.int/node/690209,2014-09-10
"Flood waters recede, but real challenge begins now",09 Sep 2014,"

JAMMU: The toll from devastating floods in Jammu & Kashmir has crossed 200 even as surging waters began to recede on Tuesday.
Officials said the toll was feared to go up further as the extent of the damage was likely to be clearer in the coming days after the water recedes completely for authorities to assess the situation.
Rescue operations continued to be hampered as large parts of the state continued to be cut off from the outside world and reachable only by air.
Officials said the lifeline — Jammu-Kashmir national highway, the only route connecting the valley to the outside world, remained closed for the seventh day. Vast swathes of the road have been washed away. Large parts of the state remained without electricity while drinking water too was scarce.
All India Radio and Doordarshan stations near the swollen Jehlum River, which has flooded several posh areas, remained off air as their premises remained flooded along with key buildings including the civil secretariat, the high court and the police control room.
The radio station had done a commendable job by running a live helpline before it went off air on Sunday. Residences of several key police officers, bureaucrats and ministers too were submerged. This included state flood control minister Sham Lal Sharma's house in Srinagar's Church Lane area. Unconfirmed reports said the missing included some lawmakers and ministers.
The Army said it has pressed over one Lakh soldiers for the rescue operations. They are equipped with 170 boats to evacuate marooned residents. Over 40 boats were flown from Rajasthan and Punjab on Tuesday along with 10 medical teams.
""Army medical authorities have flown in two tons of medical stores capable of treating more than 7,000 patients from Kanpur,"" said defence spokesman S D Goswami. He said over 30,000 people have been evacuated to safer places.
Cooked, ready to eat food packages and 30 tons of bottled water were airlifted for distribution among an estimated four lakh people marooned in flood waters. Many of those stranded remained perched on rooftops. Reports said over 2,000 villages were submerged in Kashmir along with Srinagar.
Landline phones were restored in areas near the Srinagar airport in a major relief to authorities. Breakdown of communication networks since Sunday had hampered rescue operations. Officials said telephone networks were being restored on war footing.
The water levels in areas inundated due to breaches in Jehlum receded. But the water level of the Dal Lake was steadily rising as the Jehlum waters were diverted into it.
Overflowing waters from the lake had entered areas around the Hazratbal shrine and the nearby National Institute of Technology campus. Many residents complained rescuers had not reached them yet.
A news agency quoted an unnamed Disaster Response Force official saying ""the damage is shocking"" with people stranded on their rooftops.
Officials pleading anonymity said the rescue operations were delayed in Kashmir as flood alerts were not issued on time. An official was quoted saying ""they were all caught off guard because there was not a single warning issued by the weather office"". The Central Water Commission has taken a lot of flak for not issuing flood advisories.
Additional disaster response teams were separately rushed to Srinagar, where the Union home ministry set up a control room to oversee rescue operations.
In Jammu region, the worst-hit Rajouri and Poonch districts remained cut off. Relief material was flown it but it has not been reportedly distributed in the remote areas. Sources said at least 143 people have died in the Jammu region alone.
The train service to Vaishno Devi near Jammu was restored days after Shri Shakti Express was stuck at Ramnagar due to mudslides on Saturday. The pilgrimage to the shrine was resumed on Monday after four days.",https://reliefweb.int/node/690121,2014-09-09

Monsoon delivers a hard blow to farmers,01 Sep 2014,"
Flood and drought - farmers across the country have seen both as this year’s monsoon has featured late and erratic rains. This report details the situation as it is on the ground.
High food Inflation has been pinching Indians for the last few months and with the current monsoon not being very generous to farmers, the situation is only expected to worsen. As of August 29th, rainfall deficiency in the country was 18 per cent, a much improved figure from the 41 per cent deviation recorded at the start of monsoon. This was all thanks to heavy showers, which also led to floods in Odisha, Assam and Bihar.
The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) downgraded its prediction for overall rainfall deficiency from 7 per cent to 13 per cent, which brings the country closer to drought. A drought is declared when overall deficiency is more than 10 per cent and over 20 per cent of country’s area is affected by drought-like conditions.
IMD is still hoping for the figures to improve by the time the clouds recede from the country in September. Most of the northwest, which makes the maximum contribution to the nation’s granaries, has not had much rainfall. The decline ranges from 65 per cent in the case of Punjab to 40 per cent in eastern Uttar Pradesh.
Western Rajasthan and Vidarbha, two of the most water-stressed regions of India known for distress migration and farmer suicides respectively, are staring at a greater crisis if the current trend of deficient rainfall continues.
By August 29, kharif crops were sown in 966.25 lakh hectares. Last year, the figure was 998.01 lakh hectares during the same period. The major drop in acreage has been for coarse cereals, oilseeds and pulses.
The Centre has raised to 50 per cent the subsidy ceiling to buy seeds from the existing level. At present, seed subsidy is given in the range of Rs 1,500-5,000 per quintal under the National Food Security Mission depending on the varieties of seeds to partially compensate farmers for re-sowing crops in drought-declared areas. However, none of the states has declared drought yet. “Drought has become a political issue in India. If a state government declares drought, it has to pay 50 per cent of the relief amount to the farmers before the Centre releases its share. Today, each state wants a relief package but without having to shell out anything,” Sharma says.
The major reservoirs of the country were filled to less than two thirds of their total capacity (155.05 billion cubic metres) on August 21, which is 85 per cent down from last year. This will not only impact irrigation of both the kharif and rabi crops, but will also impact the production of power, some of which is again used for irrigation through tubewells.

"Rail, road traffic disrupted as rain continues in Himachal Pradesh",12 Aug 2013,"
S Gopal Puri, TNN | Aug 12, 2013, 05.36 AM IST
DHARAMSHALA: Constant rainfall in Himachal Pradesh has caused massive destruction in the lower parts of the state, with rural areas and villages being the worst affected. Rail and bus services have been crippled in the area with most of the rivers in spate causing damage to bridges. The meteorological department has announced heavy rainfall after August 12.
The Pathankot-Jogindernagar narrow rail line has been rendered useless for at least two weeks due to landslides along the track, a railway official said on Sunday. The Pathankot-Mandi national highway also witnessed landslides at many places, which halted traffic on the route for hours, causing traffic jams.
About 100 families in Kandrori area were evacuated and provided temporary shelter and food as gushing flood waters ravaged the villages after release of 60,000 cusecs of water from Maharana Pratap Sagar Reservoir (Pong Dam). Mand, Miyani, Gandrah, Bhograma, Parag, Reyali and Rey villages were worst hit and crops on several acres of lands were destroyed. A dozen panchayts in Mand area of Nurpur sub-division were flooded.
Bhakhra Beas Management Board (BBMB) has been constantly discharging water through spillways of Pong Dam since August, 6 as the inflow has increased due to torrential rains. Inflow of water into the reservoir on Saturday was recorded at 94,000 cusecs. The BBMB authorities discharged 60,000 cusecs of water into the Beas River through floodgates on Saturday.
Water level at the reservoir stood at 1,380 feet on Saturday, which is 57 feet higher as compared to last year's 1,323 feet on the same date. Deputy commissioner C Pal Rasu said around half-a-dozen villages were affected as water entered into their houses while paddy, maize and sugarcane crop had also been damaged.
Rasu said warning had been issued in villages situated in downstream areas of Pong Dam and boats have been arranged to evacuate people in case of emergency. He said situation was under control as BBMB authorities had already informed the district administration about water release.
""According BBMB authorities there is a possibility of release 1 lakh cusecs of water from the Pong Dam reservoir, so we have alerted people in the area to move to safer places,"" said he said. ""We are continuously monitoring the situation and revenue officer of the area has been made the field officer who will submit a report about the situation every day"" he added.
Pong Dam can store water up to 1,395 feet against the danger mark of 1,390 feet. The dam meets the irrigation requirements of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and some parts of Himachal Pradesh.",https://reliefweb.int/node/594982,2013-08-12

Villagers still stuck with little to eat,07 Jul 2013,"
Swati Mathur, TNN | Jul 7, 2013, 03.00 AM IST
DEHRADUN: Even as relief material poured into Dehradun for the 15th straight day, people in the flood-affected districts of Uttarakhand continued to remain deprived of vital rations. The state government said relief material was being sent to Chamoli, Pithoragarh, Rudraprayag and Bageshwar every day, but disaster hit families alleged the distribution system had failed.
Bottlenecks exist partly because there is no systematic distribution roster in place even after 18 days. Although relief stuff is being despatched from Dehradun as officials say, large unused stocks are piling up in Joshimath and Rishikesh where a glut builds partly due to government apathy and partly because of poor weather and connectivity.
""We're despatching about 35 to 40 small relief trucks daily. However, if there are roadblocks in the distribution process, we do not know of it,"" said Manu Bhardwaj, a volunteer at the Sports College storage camp in Raipur, Dehradun.
Government officials confirmed they had received over 400 large relief trucks since June 22 when supplies started pouring in from various parts of the country. Additional rations are still coming in from Gujarat, Punjab and Haryana.
""We were told rations will be distributed to us on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. However, the days passed without any relief,"" said Arvind Sharma, resident of flood-hit Pandukeshwar village.
In Mana, the last Indian village along the Indo-Tibetan border, only 40 of the 200 families said they have received their share of relief. A tea-stall owner, Bhawani, said, ""Although the administration announced it has completed the distribution of relief material to Mana, we've no such information.""
Also, contrary to its promise of reaching relief to every family, the government is handing over supplies to tehsildars and village sarpanchs, leading to allegations of discrepancy and biased distribution. Expressing satisfaction with the way the government has handled relief though, revenue secretary Bhaskaranand Joshi said, ""The government was focusing on getting pilgrims out first. Relief will follow.""
Supplies for flood-hit people include food grains, clothes, ready-to-eat food, used and new clothes and utensils, among other things. Although large quantities of bottled mineral water are also being supplied, volunteers managing relief camps said this is mostly needed in Uttarkashi.
Describing the government's decision to send in mineral water as shortsighted, joint advisor, operations, at the National Disaster Management Authority, Vinay Kajla, said, ""Instead of bottled water, the government should have sent in a water filtration or treatment system. No one seems to have thought what will happen once relief supplies dry up and people are forced to return to the old sources of drinking water. In places like the Kedar valley, the risk of water contamination will be high.""",https://reliefweb.int/node/587489,2013-07-07

Preparations for Monsoon,23 Jul 2012,"
The Central Government has prepared extensive plans to deal with the deficiency in the Monsoon/rainfall in some parts of the country.  The Government is in full readiness to address any situation that may arise due to any rainfall anomalies.  The Prime Minister has been apprised of the situation and has directed all departments and ministries to co-ordinate efforts with State Governments to meet any eventuality and monitor the situation on a weekly basis.
Situation So Far
The progress of the Monsoon so far has not allayed earlier concerns.  The rainfall deficiency which existed at  the end of June has lessened somewhat, but the intensity and spread of rainfall over the next week or so needs to be watched carefully, especially in Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan
The India Meteorological Department's second stage forecast on 22.6.2012 predicted rainfall over the whole Monsoon season to be normal at 96% of Long Period Average (LPA) with model error of ±4%, but this is now reportedly likely to be around the lower end of the range.  As on 15.7.2012, monsoon has covered all parts of the country.  The cumulative rainfall for the period from 01.06.2012 to 15.07.2012 is 22% less than the LPA.  Rainfall over the four geographical regions of North-West, Central, South Peninsula and East and North-East India for this period has been lower than their LPAs by 33%, 26%. 26% and 10% respectively.  Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Saurashtra and Karnataka have till now received low rainfall.  On the other hand, the North East region, North Bihar and North Bengal have received and are likely to continue to receive heavy rainfall.  The overall figure of 22% deficit can, however, be misleading as the unevenness of distribution and periodicity of rainfall are also factors to be taken into account.
The 84 major reservoirs in the country that are being monitored by Central Water Commission have now begun to get filled but the current year storage is still 61% of last year storage and 78% normal ten-year average storage.  However the levels in the reservoirs in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan are more than the ten yearly average.  The Ministry of Water Resources indicates that there is no real cause for concern as the reservoirs are now getting filled with heavy rains in the foothills of Himalayas, North-East and parts of Southern India.
There has been reduction of around eight million hectares in the crop area sown compared to last year. While the reduction in area sown in case of rice could be covered over time,  area reduction in coarse cereals is likely to persist.
Steps taken:
a. Contingency plans have been prepared by the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation and shared with the States.  These will be rolled out in the areas which continue to receive low rainfall.
b. There is sufficient availability of all seeds including of coarse cereals and pulses.  In Assam, which is affected by flood, seeds of submergence tolerant varieties are being provided.  Similarly, for flood prone North Bihar and West Bengal, sufficient seeds and such varieties are available.
c. Suitable advisories regarding fodder availability have been issued in the States by the Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries.  These include preservation of crop residue that may be used as fodder in the nest season.  Sufficient funds for this purpose are available with the State Governments under various schemes.
d. Sufficient seeds for various fodder crops such as maize, sorghum and bajra are available and will be made available to the State Governments, as and when required.
e. All options for increasing fodder availability under Joint Forest Management Programme will be explored by the Ministry of Environment and Forests.
f. Power availability for agricultural purposes will be ensured so that yield of rice is not adversely affected.  Unallocated power of approximately 300 MW each is being made available to Punjab, Haryana and UP by the Ministry of Power.  This represents about 75% of the total unallocated power available for the Northern Region.  In addition, Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has been asked to ensure availability of diesel in the States, especially in North West India.
g. The need for according the highest priority to drinking water was stressed. The Ministry of Drinking Water & Sanitation will henceforth be monitoring the status of the affected habitations on a weekly basis, rather than on a fortnightly basis as is presently being done.
h. Adequate reservation for drinking water in the reservoirs will be ensured. States have been advised to phase out the release of reservoir water for irrigation in a way that in the event of there being less rainfall later on further requests can be met.
i. While the prices of wheat and rice are stable, the prices of sugar, pulses and vegetable are showing an upward trend.  A proposal for increase in subsidy for supply of pulses through Public Distribution System to BPL families is being brought before Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution.
j. Any additional requirement for wages under the MGNREGA scheme will be met by the Department of Rural Development.  Rs.12,000 crore have already been released to the States during the current year.  States have sufficient funds in hand.  Increase in demand for employment has been reported only from a few States so far.  The shelf of works to absorb additional labour has been kept ready with the States.
k. Sufficient funds to the tune of Rs.4524 crore are currently available under National Disaster Relief Fund.
l. An Inter-Ministerial Group under Secretary, Department of Agriculture and Cooperation is reviewing the situation on a weekly basis and also holding video conference with the State Governments.",https://reliefweb.int/node/512568,2012-07-23

"Flood control: Officials, residents disagree on preparedness",17 Jul 2012,"
Parvesh Kumar Sharma, TNN | Jul 17, 2012, 04.16AM IST
PATIALA: The losses running into crores of rupees due to floods in Patiala district two years ago do not seem to have taught the administration any lesson. Lack of preparedness and failure to clean seasonal rivulets may again cost the residents dear this year too. Last Wednesday, the officials declared that they had completed all the works, but there is hardly anything to show on ground. In fact, residents are still waiting for work to begin on the cleaning of water channels.
""We have completed our all preparations for flood control and cleaned up all season rivulets in the district,"" claimed Patiala DC G K Singh after a meeting of flood coordination committee.
However, there are no takers for the official claims. ""We have not seen any cleaning of any rivulet,"" said some farmers working in field near Devigarh.
The DC is apparently completely unaware about the agitation and signature campaign launched by residents of Tafajalpura, Gurbax Colony, Guru Nanak Nagar, New Bishan Nagar, Purana Bishan Nagar, Deen Dyal Upadhya Nagar, Ram Nagar, SST Nagar, Mathura Colony, Jagdish Colony and many other areas last Sunday to protest against the lack of cleaning of Chhoti Nadi. The residents have now decided to approach the chief minister for the cleaning of Chhoti Nadi as they fear that it may not only cause floods but also lead to an outbreak of epidemic because of the dirty sewage water discharged in it.
""The administration is lying. We request the Punjab chief minister to take strict action against all officers, who have sent fake reports of cleaning and order a high level inquiry to know the utilization of funds,"" they demanded.
Sources said there are around 17 drains in Patiala and many other seasonal rivulets and rivers like Ghaggar, Tangri, Markanda and Pachi Dara. In 2010, lack of cleaning had led to around 50 breaches, which led to floods and losses of Rs 63 crores in 200 villages of Patiala.
Estimates prepared by the district drainage department reveal that it needs at least Rs 6.50 crores for the repair and cleaning of water channels.",https://reliefweb.int/node/511153,2012-07-17

With so many districts flooded, many have been forced to build temporary shelters on flood embankments, like here in Barabanki district of Uttar Pradesh.
The IRCS, a member of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the world’s largest humanitarian organization, with millions of active volunteers across 186 countries has responded to the floods in India that have affected 8.6 million people. The floods have so far claimed 310 lives, 6371 life stock is lost and 63190 houses are completely damaged.
In brief
Individuals and organizations may contribute to the Indian Red Cross Society’s humanitarian efforts through financial contributions in favour of the Secretary General, Indian Red Cross Society. The Indian Red Cross Society is consistently working towards easing the sufferings of the flood victims in India by providing non-food relief and service assistance. As an immediate response to the floods, the IRCS provided relief items amounting to in excess of INR 38,000,000, however more needs to be done to assist the states most severely affected by flooding this monsoon season. Trained assessment teams have already visited the affected regions to detail the exact requirements of the communities affected. Based on these field assessments, the society looks forward for an assistance of INR 176,280,000 to address the needs of 250,000 people (50,000 households) for a period of 6 months.

"Hansi-Butana wall worries Punjab villagers
",13 May 2011,"
SANGRUR: As if a swelling Ghaggar during monsoons was not enough for causing damage, the construction of a 10-foot high concrete wall along the Hansi-Butana canal in Haryana is also expected to severely affect people living near the seasonal river.
The residents of about two dozen villages situated near Ghaggar`s banks are a worried lot because of the construction.
They have decided to approach state and Union authorities against this.
The wall would block the flow of flood waters towards Guhla-Cheeka side in Haryana and would keep it back in villages of Sangrur and Patiala districts, say residents of the area.
Punjab had challenged the Hansi-Butana construction in Supreme Court.
""Injustice is being meted out to residents of about two dozen villages already living at the mercy of the authorities` attitude as the construction of the wall along Hansi-Butana in four-km area would ensure flooding of these villages completely,"" said Ghaggar Control Committee chairman Jugraj Singh Hotipur.
Hotipur said it was suggested long back that Haryana be allowed to use Ghaggar water from Hansi-Butana regulator during paddy season, but no heed was given to the suggestion.
Makrod Sahib resident Joginder Singh said people had still not forgotten floods of 2010 and with the construction of Hansi Butana wall they would have to face more such problems, as at that time, some of the water had spread into Haryana allowing the flood`s intensity to come down.
He added that construction of the wall would prove disastrous for many Punjabi villages and if state authorities did not come forward in saving villages, they would be ruined if Ghaggar showed its fury.
State irrigation minister Janmeja Singh Sekhon said Punjab would oppose the wall`s construction strongly and the matter would soon be raised before Union government.",https://reliefweb.int/node/401633,2011-05-13

"India: Ignoring flood warnings, Punjab, Haryana engage in blame-game",20 Jul 2010,"
CHANDIGARH: As Punjab and Haryana engage
in mudslinging over the recent floods that have left them counting their
losses and looking up to the Centre to foot the bills, the disturbing question
is whether the two governments can absolve themselves for doing precious
little in preventing a ''manmade"" situation despite forewarnings.
With disaster management conspicuous
by its absence, a Punjab irrigation official, requesting anonymity, said,
""Ghaggar, known as the river of misery in the two states, can be tamed
with the help of three damns. But the two governments have been bickering
over their construction for several years.""
Earlier this year, when TOI had contacted
Paswan Bansal, Union minister of state for water resources, on Ghaggar's
notoriety, he too blamed the states saying, ''They have to resolve the
issue between themselves."" But nothing has happened, with the river,
once again, causing mayhem.
Also, two years ago, Punjab is learned
to have cautioned the Central Water Commission, Centre and other agencies
on impending floods because ""design of the under-construction Hansi-Butana
canal was structurally faulty"".
In a letter written to the central government,
late cooperation minister Capt Kanwaljit Singh had cited a study by Rakesh
Khosa, senior professor at IIT, Delhi: ""... Heightened floods will
cause extensive damage in Punjab and the canal may prove to be an environmental
hazard... Also no provision has been made for draining out sheetflow....""
Punjab is still found severely wanting
in safeguarding embankments or rushing relief to the flood-hit. Army has
been summoned to plug breaches, while marooned villagers have cut roads
and embankments of empty channels to drain water from their areas.
On its part, Haryana too has failed to
apprehend threat from the breaching Hansi-Butana. And though the government
wants the abandoned Satluj-Yamuna Link canal to be operational at any cost,
it has done nothing to carry out repairs in the neglected canal, which
has given into fissures.
Flood victims are naturally furious.
''It's shameful how governments blame farmers for causing breaches, even
threatening to book us. Are we supposed to stand and watch while our children
starve and crops died. The water has to be drained out and so we have cut
roads or diverted flood waters to empty channels. No government has come
to help us,"" said Kultar Singh, a Patiala village farmer.
Meanwhile, both states have made a case
for huge compensation packages from the central government - Haryana's
astounding Rs 1,346.81 crore and Punjab's preliminary estimate of Rs 300
crore even as assessment is still on in Sangrur and Mansa districts. Punjab
has also demanded damages of Rs 10,000 against the existing Rs 1,600 per
acre of crop loss.",https://reliefweb.int/node/361647,2010-07-20

for immediate flood relief work. In its advisory to the Punjab and Haryana
governments, the home ministry said the balance available with Punjab was
Rs 2,316 crore and Haryana Rs 1,151 crore.
""The state governments have been
advised to utilize these resources immediately in terms of extant guidelines.
They have also been informed that in case of additional central assistance,
a memorandum indicating the total assessed damage may be sent to the central
government,"" said an official.
Meanwhile, the home ministry has sent
teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) consisting of 206
personnel along with 32 boats to Haryana. Similarly, five NDRF teams consisting
of 194 personnel along with 28 boats have been deployed in Punjab.
The flood situation in both the states
continues to remain grim with many places marooned after heavy rains caused
fresh breaches in river embankments and canals.",https://reliefweb.int/node/360970,2010-07-14
India: Fresh showers add to woes in region,13 Jul 2010,"
CHANDIGARH: Fresh bouts of rain in already-inundated
areas of Punjab and Haryana worsened the flood situation on Monday as 26
more breaches in the Ghaggar and smaller rivers like Sagarpada and Markanda
left more areas marooned. The death toll in Punjab went up to 22 as two
more bodies were recovered in Patiala.
An 80-feet-long breach in Sangrur district
of Punjab on Monday, added to the woes of the villagers.
And, with the government failing to provide
adequate relief, there have been growing instances of public anger. On
Sunday, Haryana police had to resort to lathicharge in Meondkalan village
in Fatehabad district when people gheraoed chief parliamentary secretary
Prahlad Singh Gillakherha who had gone there to review the flood situation.
Additional police forces had to be deployed in the area to maintain peace.
While traffic on roads is flowing, movement
of trains is still affected, with important trains like the Shatabdi Express,
Himalayan Queen and Sadhbhavna Express running late as repair work on the
tracks near Ambala is still on.
In Haryana, the overflowing Ghaggar flooded
dozen odd villages in Fatehabad and Sirsa on Monday, and villagers had
to be evacuated in special boats.
In Punjab, while only 14 out of the 33
breaches in the Ghaggar have been plugged, fresh rains in Patiala, Gurdaspur,
Fatehgarh Sahib, Hoshiarpur, Ferozepur, Ludhiana and Amritsar caused fresh
worries as water in the Ghaggar and Bhakra Main Line canal flowed above
the warning level.
In Haryana, rains lashed parts of Ambala,
Yamunanagar, Bhiwani, Rohtak and Jhajjar districts, while very heavy rains
were recorded in Fatehabad, Sirsa and Hisar districts.
A total of six lakh acres of agricultural
land in Punjab and Haryana have been submerged, sinking hopes of thousands
of farmers who had planted paddy. As many as 814 villages in Punjab got
flooded, with 283 in Patiala district and 200 in Ludhiana. Over 1,967 km
of road network has been fully damaged or washed away in the floods in
Punjab alone.",https://reliefweb.int/node/360982,2010-07-13

"India: Rs 1300cr flood loss in Haryana, Punjab",11 Jul 2010,"
CHANDIGARH: Breaches along the embankment
of the Ghaggar flooded more villages in Punjab's Sangrur and Haryana's
Fatehabad districts on Saturday. Initial estimates suggest damage to paddy
crop in over 2 lakh acre each in the two states.
The train services in Delhi-Amritsar
section were restored after two days after tracks at Shahbad were repaired
on Saturday.
In Haryana, government agencies put the
losses at over Rs 1,000 crore. A door-to-door survey is being conducted
to assess actual losses.
According to a preliminary assessment
by Punjab government, the flood-affected districts have suffered losses
worth around Rs 300 crore in crops and infrastructure. ""These figures
are mounting as floods are affecting fresh areas every day. We want a central
government team to assess the losses,"" said a senior Punjab government
official.
Patiala in Punjab seems to be the worst
affected district, where only 5 out of 25 breaches have been plugged so
far. Even though there were no rains in the last three days, 25 villages
still remain submerged. Floods have damaged 190 link roads in Patiala.
Surging Ghaggar water has cut off eight villages in Sangrur from rest of
Punjab.
National Disaster Response Force (NDRF)
teams began rescue operations in the two states with the help of 18 boats.
However, slow pace of relief operations
has angered flood victims. Reports said the Sangrur DC was heckled by villagers
at Karail. In Patiala villagers depended mainly on the Army for food and
water.",https://reliefweb.int/node/360755,2010-07-11

NEW DELHI/CHANDIGARH: With unrelenting
rains over the past 36 hours, the three northern states of Punjab, Haryana
and Himachal Pradesh have got all but cut off from the rest of the country,
with most major roads and rail tracks flooded and unusable. 
Buses, trains and other vehicles were
stranded and the situation is fast turning grim for those along riverine
areas in the three states. While small rivulets like Tangri near Ambala
and Markanada were flowing way above the danger mark, the bigger rivers,
the Sutlej in Himachal and Beas along Kulu Manali, too, have turned menacing.
The Army was called to help evacuate people in Kurukshetra and Shahbad.
Ghaggar and Rugn in Punjab as well as Haryana are also threatening to break
their banks. 
Heavy downpour forced air passengers,
including cricketers Yuvraj Singh and Harbhajan Singh, to wade through
water at Chandigarh airport. ''There was at least two feet of water along
the pathway leading to the terminal. I had to wade through water for my
flight to Delhi,'' Yuvraj told TOI.",https://reliefweb.int/node/360299,2010-07-07

South Asia: Appeal 2009-2010 (MAA52001) Programme Update No. 02,21 Dec 2009,"
This report covers the period 1 July
to 31 December 2009.
Programme purpose: As outlined
in the 2009-10 plan, the aim of the International Federation is to coordinate
and support efforts at country and regional level to assist South Asian
national societies to scale up their work to improve the lives of vulnerable
people.
Programme summary: The disaster
season throughout the region was relatively calm in its first half though
Sri Lanka witnessed one of its worst dengue outbreaks in years as health
authorities scrambled to contain the disease.
Late floods in India during October affected
six different states across the country, out of which Andhra Pradesh and
Karnataka were the most affected.
In Nepal, the 2008 Koshi River floods
appeal closed at the end of August. Another flood /landslide in the first
week of October 2009 affected more than 14 districts of the far western
region of Nepal. The flood and landslides claimed 62 lives, affecting more
than 27,000 families and more than 150,000 individuals. Following an assessment,
a Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) of approximately CHF 307,000 (USD
294,763 or EUR 205,656) has been allocated for the distribution of non-food
items to some 4,000 affected families and replenishment of emergency stocks
During the cyclone Aila operation, Bangladesh
Red Crescent Society (BDRCS) and the International Federation successfully
completed the distribution of shelter kits and household items to 7,000
the affected families in Satkhira and Khulna districts. Low-lying areas
of the northern, north-eastern and central districts of Bangladesh were
inundated by heavy downpour and flash flood during the third week of August
2009. However, considering the overall improvement of the flood situation
and intervention by the government through its safety net programmes, no
international intervention was needed.
Due to military operations in south Waziristan
in Pakistan, a fresh group of internally displaced people are moving into
western Punjab. Approximately 200,000 displaced people are expected to
leave the conflict area. According to government estimates, 2,500 to 3,000
displaced families are still staying back in Hazara division and Attock
district. Latest figures on the displaced people suggest that more than
1.65 million (out of 2.7 million) displaced families have returned to their
homes in Malakand division. Some 7,200 displaced families have so far received
non-food items.
Financial situation: The total
2009 budget was revised downwards from CHF 3,158,085 (USD 3,161,246 or
EUR 2,094,790) to CHF 2,241,787 (USD 2,244,031 or EUR 1,487,000) based
on the programmes' workplan and funding situation. Coverage is 135 per
cent while expenditure from January to October 2009 is 65 per cent of the
total 2009 budget. The financial report from January to December 2009 will
be issued with the 2009 annual report by April 2010.
No. of people we help: The South
Asia regional office supports the seven national societies and seven country
offices of the International Federation in South Asia. The South Asia regional
office is also actively working with the authorities in Bhutan providing
disaster management and risk reduction training for their leadership. The
region includes Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka, out of which the national societies exist in all
except Bhutan. Please refer to the country reports for the number of people
reached in each country.
Our partners: The main partners
supporting the regional programmes during 2009 were the American, British,
Danish, Finnish, Japanese and Swedish Red Cross Societies, along with the
European Commission/ECHO, British Department for International Development
(DFID) and World Bank (GFDRR). Technical partnerships/relations were also
maintained with the Asian Disaster Preparedness Centre, the South Asia
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) disaster management centre,
United Nations (UN) International Strategy for Disaster Response, World
Bank (through the ProVention consortium), other UN organizations, governmental
and non-governmental organizations under the regional disaster management
programme; and with the World Health Organization, networks of people living
with HIV, government ministries and civil society organizations under the
regional health and care programmes. The South Asia regional office also
maintained strong cooperation with the International Committee of the Red
Cross (ICRC) and links with the World Food Programme, United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) and United Nations Agency for International Development
(USAID). Further, close cooperation was continued with international media
agencies like Reuters, BBC and CNN for efficient information flow, especially
during disasters.
The International Federation, on behalf
of the national societies in the South Asia region, would like to thank
the above mentioned partners for their generous support.",https://reliefweb.int/node/337810,2009-12-21

The floods in India this year, particularly
in the state of Bihar, have caused unprecedented loss to lives and property.
According to government figures, vast areas of agricultural land have been
inundated and a large number of houses have collapsed or been destroyed
(597,000 houses have been fully damaged while 418,497 houses have been
partially damaged). With over 18.6 million people affected across India
and 1,778 people killed, it has been a major blow to the country's economy
and people. 
The Prime Minister of India has declared
the Bihar floods a national calamity. The National Crisis Management Committee
carried out the latest aerial survey in the state and confirmed that the
destruction is ongoing. The government has stepped up its relief efforts
at all levels and the Bihar state government has sought the support of
civil society organisations in stepping up its relief efforts. 
The major highlighted needs remain drinking
water, food and household items, together with tracing support as most
of the affected population remains psychologically affected due to loss
of family members. The International Federation is coordinating within
and outside the Movement to support the Indian Red Cross Society in responding
efficiently to the disaster. 
The Situation 
The situation continues to look very
grim. The rains have not stopped and the water levels continue to rise.
The state of Bihar is facing some of the worst flooding in 50 years. The
Kosi river coming from Nepal in the north has burst its banks causing the
river to change its course, affecting new areas of Bihar less prepared
for such floods (Madhepura, Purnia, Saharsa, Supaul, Araria and Katihar
districts). Latest reports from the Ministry of Home Affairs indicate that
over 3.3 million people from 1,849 villages in 16 districts of the state
have been affected. Seven more deaths reported in the past 24 hours has
taken the total death toll to 63. Two million people are estimated to have
been cut off by the flood waters. The state government has said that all
marooned people will be evacuated within three days (approximately 497,300
people have been evacuated so far). Infrastructure (roads, rail, water
and electricity) have been completely or partially destroyed or are under
water in major parts of the affected areas. The population is in immediate
need of food, clean water, shelter and basic health support. Following
which, in the midterm, livelihood support will become important as field,
livestock and seed supplies have been badly affected. 
In severely hit Supaul district, approximately
893,790 people in 243 villages have been affected, and 22,000 people are
living in 36 relief camps. Around 65,000 people have been evacuated with
the help of 229 local boats and 12 motor boats. A total of 223,446 houses
(temporary and permanent) have been destroyed and 13,550 cattle have 2
been lost. The cattle that could be saved have been shifted into animal
camps. The total land under crops that has been damaged is 0.14 million
hectares.

shelter. More than 95,000 people have been evacuated in the district with
the help of 177 local boats and 25 motor boats. The government and other
civil agencies have set up almost 20 animal camps for protecting cattle
and 40 medical centres for providing immediate medical aid to the affected
people. District authorities have so far distributed dry ration (including
38,100 kilograms of beaten rice, 8,000 kilograms of jaggery and 5,000 kilograms
of gram powder) and 60,584 bed-sheets. 
In Araria district, over 0.25 million
people have been affected in 30 villages. Presently 33 relief camps are

of 439 boats have been pressed into service for relief and rescue efforts
in the district. In addition, 14 medical centres have been set up and have
provided treatment to 5,887 people, and eight tube wells and 10 temporary
laboratories have been constructed to support government efforts in the
district.

has been destroyed. A total of 152 medical teams have been deployed and
26 boats have been pressed into service for rescue and relief. The river
Ganga is still flowing above its danger mark in Farakkha district. 
The Central Water Commission has reported
that the latest position of the rivers Ganga, Ghaghra, Burhi Gandhak, Baghmati,
Adhwara, Kamla Balan and Mahananda is that they continue to be flowing
above their danger levels at various places in Bihar state. The latest
weather predictions by the Indian Meteorological Department (valid upto
4th September) show that the current situation is likely to continue during
the next 2-3 days. Fairly widespread rainfall, with isolated heavy to very
heavy rainfall, is likely over the north-eastern states (including Arunachal
Pradesh, Assam and Meghalaya) and sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim
during the next three days, with a likelihood of a decrease thereafter.
Further, embedded cyclonic circulations persist over southwest Bay of Bengal
(off the north Tamil Nadu coast) and over interior Karnataka. Under this
influence, scattered to fairly widespread rains/thundershowers are likely
along the west coast and over parts of the southern peninsula of India
during the next two days. Scattered and fairly widespread rainfall is also
likely in north-western and central India.",https://reliefweb.int/node/278859,2008-09-03

Monsoon Watch
- The normal date of withdrawal of southwest
monsoon from West Rajasthan is 1st September. Though there is no rainfall
over West Rajasthan for the last 5 days and also there is considerable
reduction in moisture content, but the lower tropospheric wind pattern
is not yet conducive for commencement of withdrawal phase of monsoon.
Chief features
- The axis of monsoon trough continues
to run close to foothills of the Himalayas. The similar scenario is likely
to continue during next 2-3 days. Fairly widespread rainfall activity with
isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely over northeastern States,
Sub- Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim during next 3 days and decrease thereafter.
- An east-west shear zone lies with embedded
cyclonic circulations over southwest Bay of Bengal off north Tamil Nadu
coast and another over Interior Karnataka. Under its influence, scattered
to fairly widespread rain/thundershower activity is likely along the west
coast and over parts of south Peninsula during next 2 days.

India: Floods - Information Bulletin n° 4,29 Aug 2008,"
GLIDE FL-2008-000145-IND
The state of Bihar is facing one of the
worst floods in 50 years, as the river Kosi in Nepal has discharged huge
levels of water, running down to the bordering districts of Bihar and inundating
them. A two kilometre long breach in the mud embankment has led to a change
in the course of the river Kosi, which has caused this flooding, including
inundation of those districts in Bihar which have not been affected by
floods in past 50 years.
So far, 2.6 million people have been
affected in the state and 47 people killed(1) since the breach occurred
earlier this week. The state administration was not adequately prepared
to handle such a situation. Presently the interagency group in the state
and the government are mobilising resources to combat the situation in
the state and to set up an emergency relief operation.
The Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS) has
taken a lead, with its trained volunteers and staff at the state and district
levels. The IRCS national headquarters has been in regular contact with
its branch, monitoring the day-to-day development of the floods.
The Prime Minister of India has declared
the Bihar floods a national calamity. He undertook an aerial survey of
the affected areas and declared a relief package of INR 100 million (CHF
2.5 million or USD 2.3 million), along with the release of 0.1 million
tonnes of food grain for the state. He has given an assurance that a high-level
committee will interact with the Nepal government regarding control measures
for the Kosi flooding.
The Situation
On 18 August 2008, a major breach (about
2 kilometres in length) occurred in the eastern embankment of the Kosi
river in Kusha (Indo-Nepal border). More than 3.7 million litres of water
was discharged through the breach, flooding hundreds of villages in the
districts of northern Bihar. Government sources (National Disaster Management
Division) have indicated the following figures so far:



No. of district affected

16

No. of villages affected

1,598

No. of people killed

47

No. of people affected

2.6 million

No. of houses destroyed

227,969

The 16 affected districts include Muzaffarpur,
Supaul, Patna, Katihar, Nalanda, Araria, West Champaran, Shekhpura, Saharsa,
Purnea, Saran, Begusarai, Bhagalpur, Madhepura, Vaishall and Khagaria.
Due to this huge breach in its embankment, the Kosi river has changed its
course and is now flowing through areas that have not experienced major
floods in the recent past. Since the affected areas were traditionally
not flood prone, people as well as the local administration were not adequately
prepared to deal with the floods.
In the affected districts, the road linkages
as well as water and electricity supply are badly disrupted. Railway tracks
at several places have also been submerged. Another major area of concern
is that due to continued flow of water from the breached embankment, displaced
people will not be able to go back to their original locations for at least
another two or three months. As the water will not recede until the embankment
is repaired, until then people will have to stay in relief camps being
run by the government. Most of the displaced population that is staying
in the open does not have temporary shelter material and very few have
plastic sheets. Therefore, they have to make do with bed sheets and sarees
(women's clothing item).
The general hygiene conditions in the
camps are very poor. As toilets in the camps are inadequate, people are
resorting to open defecation. This poses a great health risk with water
and vector borne diseases. A few cases of diarrhea have already been reported,
which has the potential to increase given the scorching heat, unsafe water
and poor environment conditions.
The Prime Minister of India has declared
the Bihar floods a national calamity. He undertook an aerial survey of
the affected areas and declared a relief package of INR 100 million (CHF
2.5 million or USD 2.3 million), along with the release of 0.1 million
tonnes of food grain for the state. He has given an assurance that a high-level
committee will interact with the Nepal government regarding control measures
for the Kosi flooding.
The Indian Meteorological Department
has forecasted scattered to widespread rainfall and isolated heavy showers
over parts of some north-eastern states of India (Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim
and Meghalaya), sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Bihar and along the west coast
during next four to five days.
According to Indian Red Cross Society
(IRCS) sources, the flood situation in the state of Assam, on 28th August,
also turned grim with vast tracts of land inundated by the rising of the
Brahmaputra river and three of its tributaries to danger levels in several
districts of the state. This posed a serious threat at Morigaon, Nagaon,
Dibrugarh, Nemati and Dhuburi districts. Morigaon district was inundated
with fresh floods, with 80 villages and 6,800 hectares of paddy fields
being severely affected.
According to IRCS sources, the states
of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh have been receiving light to moderate rainfall
with intermittent heavy rains in some parts of the state. So far, 1.6 million
people have been affected from 3,686 villages in 21 districts in Uttar
Pradesh and 194,675 people have been affected from 849 villages in 11 districts
in Punjab.
A total of 12 million people have been
affected throughout the country this year and approximately 1,600 people
have been killed in 19 states2 (Himachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar
Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar, Assam, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Orissa, Tamil
Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan,
Haryana and Punjab).",https://reliefweb.int/node/278448,2008-08-29

"ACT Alert India, Nepal & Pakistan No. 32/2008: Heavy rain and floods",21 Aug 2008,"
Geneva, 21 August 2008 - The following
information was received from the United Evangelical Lutheran Churches
in India (UELCI), the Lutheran World Federation (LWF) Nepal office, and
Church World Service Pakistan/Afghanistan (CWS-P/A) :
1. Brief description and impact
- India: Heavy rain falls have occurred
for over a week in Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and different parts of India
due to low pressure and a cyclonic storm in the Bay of Bengal, resulting
in flash floods in Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and other locations. The situation
is worse in remote areas, where over 2,000 thatched houses and 320 roads
have been damaged and over 5,000 hectares of crops destroyed in Koraput
and Jeypore sub-division, Orissa. As a result, more than 300 people are
reported to have died in different parts of Andhra Pradesh and Orissa.
People's lives have been seriously affected, with agriculture paddy crops
submerged in water. Thousand of families are homeless and have relocated
to upland areas. They are in an extremely vulnerable situation without
food, shelter, and clothing. Most of them are from Dalit and tribal communities.
- Nepal: A flood disaster occurred in
Sunsari District in South Eastern Nepal in the evening of Monday, 18 August
2008. The flooding was caused due to the breach of an embankment along
the western side of the Saptakoshi River. The flood was sudden and more
than 50,000 people are affected. The number of people who have gone missing
is yet to be ascertained.
- Pakistan: Rajanpur District in Punjab
was struck by recent heavy rains, which, along with hill torrents, have
affected lives and property. Some 375,000 persons are believed to live
in the flooded areas. Current floods have damaged the cotton crop which
was about to be harvested, thus causing serious impact to economic patterns
of the local communities. Some 530,000 acres of land, including 200,000
cultivated acres, have been affected.
2. National and international response
- India: So far there has been no international
response to these floods in Orissa and Andhra Pradesh, in the operational
areas of the United Evangelical Lutheran Churches in India (UELCI) - member
churches AELC and JELC. The government and local authorities are providing
food to the affected people but did not cover all the flood-affected villages.
- Nepal: Some rescue and relief operations
from the government and Red Cross are underway. Oxfam, Caritas, World Vision,
Save the Children, UNHCR, and WFP are conducting rapid assessments, and
some have begun to distribute relief materials.
- Pakistan: The government is providing
food to the people through airdrops as well as by road, and is extending
health services with the help of some international organizations. SCF-US,
Oxfam-GB and Care International are all active in the area.
3. ACT International response
- India: ACT members in India have not
yet responded. The UELCI is planning a response. UELCI has informed ACT
India members LWS(I) and CASA about this flood situation in Andhra Pradesh
and Orissa.
- Nepal: The LWF Nepal Rapid Assessment
Team from the Eastern Region rushed to the affected area on 19 August 2008
in order to assess the situation and the specific emergency roles the LWF
Nepal could play with the affected population. LWF is yet to receive their
report. Telephone, mobile, and internet connections between Kathmandu and
the East are not functioning at the moment.
- Pakistan: CWS-P/A carried out a Rapid
Needs Assessment to the affected area, and produced a Flood Assessment
Report. Immediate needs include food, shelter, wheat seed, fertilizer,
hand pumps and hygiene kits. It is noted that an RRF, ""Floods in Pakistan
- Peshawar District and Khyber Agency"", was issued on 9 August 2008,
for an amount of US$ 59,872.
4. Planned activities
- India (UELCI): In Andhra Pradesh and
Orissa 7 districts, 92 villages, and 3500 families are planned to receive
food and non-food items. The package of assistance and relief per family
is planned as follows: food items (10 kg rice, 2 kg dal, 1 litre oil, ½
kg salt, ½ kg red chilli); and non-food items (men's wear, women's wear
and blankets).
- Nepal (LWF): Planned activities await
the results of the ongoing assessment being carried out by LWF. The assessment
report will be forwarded when completed. LWF Nepal is planning to render
assistance to the disaster-affected persons in Sunsari District, focusing
on life-saving needs.
- Pakistan (CWS): A proposed Appeal is
being put together, following the Rapid Needs Assessment.
The ACT CO awaits further information
and proposals from members in the three countries.
Any funding indication or pledge should
be communicated to Jessie Kgoroeadira, ACT Finance Officer (jkg@act-intl.org).

NEW DELHI: As people, particularly
farmers, cheered the early monsoons in north India, those in Assam blamed
it on the rain god as Army was called out to rescue marooned people in
the flood-hit state even as rain- related incidents claimed over 10 lives
elsewhere.
The Army deployed boats and rafts to
transport people taking shelter on roof tops to relief camps set up in
highlands, schools and colleges in worst-hit Lakhimpur district. The official
death count was four in the state.
An alert was sounded in coastal Orissa
as incessant rains due to deep depression over northwest Bay of Bengal,
about 250 km from Balasore coast, claimed one life in Mayurbhanj district.
Six persons were killed in separate incidents
in Uttar Pradesh due to heavy rainfall since Sunday, taking the toll of
rain-related deaths this season to 12.
A woman drowned and five houses were
damaged in Doda and Reasi districts of Jammu and Kashmir following heavy
rains and flash floods.
Landslides triggered by rains struck
en route the Vaishnodevi shrine, damaging several electric poles and disrupting
power in some areas of Katra belt.
In New Delhi, traffic snarls and water
logging failed to dampen the spirit of capital denizens as they continued
their tryst with early monsoons which gave them much needed respite from
the sultry weather.
Moderate to heavy rainfall continued
to lash most parts of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh as farmers were thrilled
it will benefit paddy plantations.
