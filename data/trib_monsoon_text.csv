"Vishav Bharti Tribune News Service Chandigarh, October 31 The Punjab Government’s policy of delaying sowing of paddy has resulted in deteriorating air quality, a study carried out by researchers of Harvard University, US, has found. The study titled “Detection of delay in post-monsoon agricultural burning across Punjab, India: potential drivers and consequences for air quality” carried out by Tianjia Liu of the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences and Loretta J Mickley of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences of Harvard University has found that a shortened harvest-to-sowing period of paddy may further encourage farmers to burn crop residue in order to sow winter wheat on time. The study based on daily satellite remote sensing data expressed concern over the increase in aerosol loading associated with an increasing trend in post-monsoon burnt area and shift toward a later peak in post-monsoon fires in northwestern India.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); “Such a shift would have implications for air quality, since peak burning is more likely to coincide with meteorological conditions that are favourable in amplifying persistent haze.” However, the burning of post-monsoon paddy residue can severely degrade air quality downwind of agricultural fires over the Indo-Gangetic Plains. “A temporal shift in fire activity to later in the year could exacerbate air quality degradation since late autumn-to-winter meteorology in the IGP favours smog formation due to weak winds, frequent temperature inversion and a shallow boundary layer,” the study observes. It estimates that on an average, the timing of peak post-monsoon fire intensity has shifted later in Punjab by 1.16 days per year in the past one-and-a-half decade. It indicates that the burning of rice residue has shifted later by over two weeks from 2003-2016. The study finds that the peak fire intensity of the post-monsoon burning season in Punjab has shifted by more than two weeks from 2003 to 2016, with a 40 per cent increase in overall fire intensity. This delay is gradual, likely influenced by steady increase in crop production and mechanisation, which yield higher amount of excess crop residue. “A shortened harvest-to-sowing turnaround time after kharif rice harvests has amplified this increase by making it difficult for farmers to prepare fields for timely sowing of rabi wheat,” the study observes. Besides, the timing of peak crop residue burning may increasingly coincide with winter meteorology that favours severe smog events downwind across the Indo-Gangetic Plains, where the study diagnoses a 50 per cent increase in aerosol optical depth (a measure of the extinction of the solar beam by dust and haze) exceedances between 2003 and 2016. Box The solution The study has observed that the solution lies in alternative technology that combines co-benefits of incorporating wheat seeds with rice residue and eliminating the need to burn residue, as well as switching to less water-intensive and stubble-producing crops, may alleviate the double bind of having to conserve groundwater while reducing public health exposure to smoke from post-monsoon fires."
"Tribune News ServiceRopar, October 31 RTI activist and lawyer Dinesh Chadha has alleged that the authorities are not taking any action against illegal mining despite National Green Tribunal (NGT) directions in this regard.Chadha had filed an application before the NGT, seeking directions to stop illegal mining in the district. On January 31, the four-member principal Bench of the NGT had asked a joint committee, comprising members of the Central Pollution Control Board, Punjab Director Mining, and Punjab State Pollution Control Board (PPCB), to take remedial measures to stop illegal mining and assess damage. The tribunal had also ordered action against the erring officials within two months.In a press conference today, Chadha said nothing had been done by the authorities concerned even nine months after the order. He said the PPCB, the nodal agency of the joint committee, had written to the Additional Deputy Commissioner (ADC))-cum-Nodal Officer, Mining, in February  this year to implement the NGT order.

"Tribune News Service Moga, October 23 Paddy yield is likely to decrease by 8 to 10 quintals per hectare due to smog caused by the rise in air pollution in Moga, Faridkot, Ferozepur, Fazilka and other districts of the Malwa belt adjoining the Pakistan border. Under normal conditions with a good monsoon, the yield this time was expected between 80 to 85 quintals per hectare, but it is likely to decrease to 70 to 75 quintals, suggested a survey conducted by Moga Plant Protection Officer Jaswinder Singh Brar. He said paddy stubble/straw burning in Amritsar, Tarn Taran and nearby areas and Pakistan’s Punjab province had increased air pollution in Moga, Faridkot, Ferozepur, Fazilka and other districts of the Malwa belt creating a belt of smog that has reduced the sunlight access on earth’s surface, affecting the growth of plants. He said the photosynthesis process in the paddy plants decreased below normal. Thus, the nutrition development in paddy plants had also decreased affecting nourishment of grains, he added. The size of paddy grains has shrunk a little. He has appealed to the farmers not to burn stubble as several farmers are yet to harvest their crops. More than 2,000 cases of paddy stubble-burning have already been detected in Amritsar and Tarn Taran districts in the Majha belt.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });"
"Tribune News Service  New Delhi, October 3  Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday urged the Central Government to take up canalisation of the state’s three eastern rivers of the Indus water system as a national project, to enable conservation of water and enhancement of the region’s economic growth.  In his proposal presented to Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a meeting here, the Chief Minister suggested construction of high-speed economic corridors on 985 km long river embankments, apart from river training works, flood protection measures and lining of internal side-slopes of the Sutlej, Ravi and Beas. The move, Capt Amarinder said, would help the state enhance its ‘jal shakti’ (water power) to encourage diversification of agriculture, promote quality urbanisation and colonisation, and to speed up industrialisation for better and quicker economic emancipation of our citizens.    Complimenting the Prime Minister on his initiative to provide drinking water to each household in the country, through the creation of the new Ministry of Jal Shakti, and the inception of Jal (water) Jeevan (life) Mission and the “Nal se Jal” (tap water) scheme, Captain Amarinder said his government also stands committed to the cause of providing drinking water to its citizens under the initiative ‘Har Ghar Pani, Har Ghar Safai’ (water and sanitation for every household).  The Chief Minister, while expressing concern over the state’s reduction in ‘jal shakti’ at the time of India’s Partition and against during the reorganisation of the state in 1966, pointed out that the three perennial rivers of the Sutlej, Ravi and Beas irrigate only about 27 per cent of the state’s cultivated area, leading to over-exploitation of the ground water. It is apprehended, he further noted, that seven districts of the state will transform into a desert in the near future, with sure signs of poverty revisiting these areas.   Underlining the need to increase water productivity through augmentation and strengthening of water management, control and regulation infrastructure, Captain Amarinder suggested launch of the cannalisation project with the Sutlej river, which would require an investment of about Rs.4000 crore (US $ 0.7 billion) over a period of 3 to 5 years, exclusive of external incentives such as commercial exploitation of Government and private land and waiver of taxes, duties and cesses, as relevant. The task may begin with a feasibility study that may be assigned to techno-economic experts of international repute, he suggested.  The Chief Minister assured that the state would extend its full cooperation to get the proposal realised in terms of sending a team of officers from the Punjab Government to engage and discuss the same with the officials of the Union Ministry of Jal Shakti.   Captain Amarinder also underlined the need to harness the river water which was currently flowing into Pakistan during the monsoons. Pointing out that the three rivers as of now have kutcha (earthen) embankments, measuring 945.24 km; (Sutlej 484.12 km, Ravi 245.28 km and Beas 215.84 km), covering almost over 60 per cent of state’s area, he observed that the 1/3rd of the state’s population living in the riverfront areas was also suffering due to the flooding that occurs during the monsoon period. The canalisation of rivers and development of riverfront areas will expand activities leading to widening of the base of Punjab’s economy, diversifying economic activities and sources of livelihood for State’s rapidly growing younger generation, he added."
"Ruchika M Khanna Tribune News Service Chandigarh, September 30 Erratic weather pattern seems to be the new normal in Punjab. The weatherman says that unlike the rest of India, where monsoon retreats by September, Punjab has seen higher than normal rains in the end of September. This, however, does not augur well for the farmers, who are ready to harvest paddy crop and realise returns for their months of toil. With north eastern and southern part of the state receiving higher than normal rainfall in the past week and an overcast sky being predicted for another two-three days, farmers are at their wits’ end. Rain at this point will add to the moisture content in paddy, making it unfit for procurement by food agencies. Thus, farmers have to delay the harvest. This year, the paddy crop was sown a week in advance, and the crop had started arriving in the mandis last week. In Khanna, commission agent Harbans Rosha told The Tribune that last week almost 3,000 quintals of non-basmati paddy had arrived before the rain started. “Since then, there have been no arrivals. Even the grain bought last week is lying in heaps without having been bought as official procurement will begin from Tuesday. I don’t expect any arrivals for the next three-four days,” he said.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The state received 137 mm rainfall in September. The farmers will have to wait for at least a week after the rain stops to begin harvesting the crop. Dr JS Mahal, Director, Extension, Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), said they had issued advisories to farmers to delay harvesting in the wake of high rainfall on September 27 and 28. “The withdrawal of monsoon is likely to get delayed due to strengthening easterly wind and approaching western disturbance in this region. Thus, farmers have been advised not to irrigate the fields,” he said."

"Our Correspondent Fazilka, September 4 After cracking the whip on sand mafia last week, Fazilka Congress legislator Davinder Singh Ghubaya has sought closure of the Fazilka-Ferozepur toll plaza in the interest of the people. A delegation of locals, led by Ghubaya, met the Deputy Commissioner recently and demanded closure of the toll plaza, claiming that the contractors had been violating various clauses of the agreement. Ghubaya claimed that the contractors, who did not have the completion certificate, were running the plaza on a provisional certificate allegedly in connivance with the government officials. Stressing that many clauses of the agreement were being flouted, the MLA said the 87-km stretch of the road did not have proper arrangements and facilities, including ambulance service and signboards. As a result, the commuters were suffering, he added. Ghubaya alleged that earlier the contractors used to fleece the commuters as the receipts issued at the toll plaza were considered valid till 12 am even if issued half an hour ago, instead of valid for a day.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); He added that after the intervention of the court now the issued receipt is considered valid for a day.

"Rajmeet Singh Tribune News Service Chandigarh, September 1 The state is paying a heavy price as the successive governments have failed to rein in the stray cattle menace. Every third day, a death or an injury due to mishaps involving stray cattle is being reported in the state. In Patiala, the home district of Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh and Local Bodies Minister Brahm Mohindra, four people have died in the past one month in such incidents. Another eight lives have been lost in Sangrur in August.

In the last three years, 370 people have died and another 167 have injured in road accidents. Given the rise in number of stray cattle-related accidents, the figure in the current year is set to rise further, said traffic adviser, Punjab, Navdeep Asija. There are 472 gaushalas in the state that shelter nearly 4 lakhs cows. But the population of stray cattle on roads has touched nearly 1.1 lakh. Despite this, the government is yet to launch any exercise on a large scale to keep tabs on stray cattle and rehabilitate them in cattle ponds by using funds collected as cow cess by different departments. As per official record, nearly Rs 34 crore collected by urban local bodies as cow cess since 2016 has not been fully unutilised. Of this, only Rs 25 crore had been distributed for feeding cattle till July. Cow cess is also being collected by the excise and taxation and transport departments. Mohindra, who had recently sought details on the collection and utilisation of cow cess from different departments, was not available for comments. Animal Husbandry Department Minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa said it was a serious problem and a lot of funds were required to address the problem. “The cow vigilante groups have aggravated the problem of stray cattle,” added Bajwa. Keemti Bhagat, former chairman of the now defunct Gau Sewa Commission, blamed the Congress government. “The government has collected Rs 75 crore as cow cess. It is public money, but the government has been holding on to the funds,” he said, adding that the Chief Minister had to take initiative to utilise the money for the purpose it was collected. Enquiries reveal that problem lies in poor utilisation and monitoring of government-run gaushalas in each of the 22 districts. During the 2018 monsoon session of the Vidhan Sabha, data shared by the Animal Husbandry Department revealed that the government-run gaushalas were being used to 50 per cent of their capacity. In wake of the increased stray cattle menace, the Local Bodies Department has sought fresh data on the utilisation of the gaushalas. 4 killed in Patiala, 8 in Sangrur last month  In Patiala, four people have died in the past one month in stray cattle-related incidents.  Another eight lives were lost in Sangrur in August.

"Vijay Mohan Tribune News Service Chandigarh, August 21 While reducing the outflow from Bhakra Dam’s floodgates tonight, the authorities have decided to bring down the water level in the reservoir, which is hovering near the top mark, by at least 5 feet over the next few days to handle the possibility of any future weather event as well as to counter the unusually high deflection of the dam’s structure. “The water level this morning was 1,679.5 feet, which will be brought down to 1,675 feet. A special technical committee meeting to review the situation was held yesterday in which all members of the partner states were of the view that the water level should be reduced by five feet,” said DK Sharma, chairman, Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) today.  In the evening, the BBMB decided that in view of inflows reducing to 45,000 cusecs and forecast of low rainfall in the coming weeks, the discharge from the spillway would be reduced from 41,000 cusecs to 18,500 cusecs. The spillway gate opening would be lowered down to four feet from the present eight feet. The reservoir’s permissible limit is 1,680 feet and the water level had gone past it following heavy rain in the catchment area. At present, the BBMB is releasing 40,000 cusecs through the spillway, in addition to 36,000 cusecs through the power generation tunnels to reduce water levels.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });  “After assessing inflows, the BBMB had released more water during May and June. The level had been brought down by 20 feet from 1,624.18 to 1,604 feet by June 25, before the onset of monsoon,” Sharma said while trying to dispel public misperception that floods were the result of water being released from Bhakra. Stating that the BBMB had no option but to discharge excess water, Sharma said a host of factors, including quantum of inflow, meteorological forecasts, seepage levels and deflection of the dam had to be taken into account. “The deflection experienced this time was among the highest such recorded instances due to the intense pressure of water,” he said. Pointing out that this year, Punjab had experienced the worst floods since 1988, Sharma said controlled release of water could successfully handle the situation. The gates of the spillway were initially opened only by three feet and thereafter by eight feet. In 1988, the gates had been opened up to 22 feet. The maximum discharge capacity of the spillway is four lakh cusecs.  Peak water generated in the Sutlej at Ropar headworks during the floods was 2.4 lakh cusecs, most of which came from rivulets downstream of the dam. Rajasthan’s requirement is 12,500 cusecs and since there is no storage means downstream of Ropar, water eventually went waste by flowing across the border. Sharma added keeping in mind the long-term health of the dam and condition of the reservoir, several projects had been initiated. This includes allocation of Rs 220 crore for undertaking a study and related works under phase-2 of the Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project that would cover structural, hydrological, seismic and geo-physical aspects. Further IITs at Roorkee and Ropar had been roped in to identify areas along the reservoir’s periphery that were prone to silt inflow and to assess the commercial exploitation of silt dredged from the reservoir bed.

"Vijay Mohan Tribune News Service Chandigarh, August 19 With water in rivulets that merge into the Sutlej downstream of the Bhakra Dam subsiding and level in the dam’s reservoir exceeding its permissible limit, authorities at the Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) have decided to increase the quantum of excess water being discharged from the dam. While the BBMB had restricted the discharge to 18,000 to 20,000 cusecs through the sluice gates at the top of the dam over the past three days, it will now discharge an additional 20,000 cusecs over the next few days to maintain the water level within the permissible limit and maintain a buffer for continuous inflows. Besides, an outflow of 36,000 is through the power generation tunnels. The water level this morning was 1,681 feet against the permissible limit of 1,680 feet. With an inflow of 91,000 cusecs, BBMB officials estimate the level to touch 1,683 feet by late night. Inflow had peaked to 3.11 lakh cusecs on August 18. “Despite heavy inflows into the reservoir, we had earlier limited the release of water from Bhakra because heavy rains in the region had generated more than two lakh cusecs in rivulets like Sirsa, Swan and Lohand, which lie between Bhakra and Ropar,” a BBMB official said.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); “Since there is no forecast of any significant rain over the next seven days, we can now release the excess water in a regulated manner,” he added. The dam’s filling season lasts till September 30 when monsoon and snowmelt recede and inflows drop. Unforeseen weather events that can bring in deluge also have to be factored in. Within a span of a year, the dam has witnessed extremities, from being virtually empty last summer with a storage reduced to just seven per cent due to historically low inflows to now managing surplus supply. BBMB officials said of the 2.40 lakh cusecs that passed downstream of Ropar, only 19,000 cusecs had been released from sluice gates. An official said minimum possible water would be released through the sluice gates and the quantum being released would not result in any adverse situation downstream. At Pong Dam, which is also witnessing inflows of 91,000 cusecs, the water level is 1,375 feet against the limit of 1,390 feet.

It will be after eight years that the reservoir, which had almost emptied out last summer due to historically low inflows, will fill up to its maximum capacity. “We are constantly assessing the situation and we have decided that as of now the volume of water being discharged through the sluice gates need not be raised further. Only the additional water accumulated so far will continue to be released downstream,” another BBMB official said. With the water levels rising rapidly, the BBMB had decided to partially open the dam’s four sluice gates to cater for increased inflows. “We are discharging 54,000 cusecs, of which 18,000 are from the sluice gates at the top of the dam and 36,000 cusecs through the power generating tunnels,” he added. “The gates have been opened to the extent of only 6 per cent.

"Vijay Mohan Tribune News Service Chandigarh, August 17 While the forecast of heavy rains in the region over the next few days poses a risk to life and property, it is also welcome news to the water management authorities as far as the Pong Dam is concerned. The reservoir at the dam, which lies in Himachal Pradesh across the Beas, is at present filled up to 60 per cent of its total capacity, which is still a notch below the average storage of the past 10 years at this time of the season.  Read Also:   Flood alert as Sutlej water enters villages Threat looms over 27 Jalandhar villages Level in Pong Dam below average, more rain won’t harm Punjab on alert as more Bhakra water on way   “Unlike the Bhakra Dam, where the water inflow is primarily dependent on snowmelt, rain water accounts for over 80 per cent of the Pong Dam’s inflow,” on official of the Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) said. Following unusual heavy rains in autumn last, the Pong Dam had filled up to full capacity but the storage had fallen to 32 per cent by early July this year, according to data available with the Central Water Commission. Both the Bhakra and Pong dams are critical for power generation and irrigation in the region. They have an installed generation capacity of 1,325 MW and 396 MW, respectively, and supply water for drinking and irrigation to Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Delhi and Chandigarh. One reason for the Pong Dam’s relatively low storage is low rainfall in the dam’s catchment area. Monsoon has been deficient by 21 per cent so far in Himachal, with the shortfall in the upper areas like Lahaul and Spiti and Chamba being as high as 68 per cent and 50 per cent, respectively. Bhakra, on the other hand has already filled up to over 82 per cent of its capacity, which is about 20 per cent more that the average storage of the past 10 years. With warnings of heavy rainfall issued by the Meteorological Department, the BBMB authorities had opened the dam’s sluice gates yesterday to release more water than usual for catering to heavy inflow. Since the dam’s filling season officially extends up to September 30 and rains as well as snowmelt are likely to continue, the BBMB authorities expect that the Bhakra Dam’s reservoir will reach its maximum permissible limit of 1,680 feet, with an additional 3 ft buffer to cater to any emergent situation like a cloudburst. This level was last achieved in 2011. The level recorded at the Bhakra Dam today was 1,675 ft.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });"

"Kulwinder Sandhu Tribune News Service Moga, August 12 With the advancement of technology, some progressive farmers in the Malwa belt of Punjab are using automatic boom sprayer machines to spray pesticides on cotton crop, which is more vulnerable to pest/insect attacks during the monsoon season. No matter, the farmers have not purchased these machines, but some private companies are offering them on rent, which is cost efficient. It saves time, labour and cost of operation as well as reduces drudgery of the spraying operation. The field capacity of the sprayer is approximately 10 acres per hour.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); As per the details available, United Phosphorus Limited (UPL), Crystal Phosphate Limited, PI Limited and their subsidiary companies are providing boom sprayers to the farmers on rent. The Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, has also launched three boom sprayers on trial basis during the current cotton season. Plant Protection Officer of Moga Dr Jaswinder Singh Brar, who is monitoring the drip-irrigated cotton crop in the Malwa belt, said the control over insects, pests, other diseases and weeds depend upon the use of proper spray technology. He said the farmers are using different types of sprayers — both manual and power-operated — but, power-operated having nozzles that discharge at least 600 ml of pesticide per minute is best for pest control. Thus, the boom sprayers, which discharge at least 600 ml of pesticide per minute is a better option. During the last winters, the state Agriculture Department launched a statewide campaign to motivate the farmers to adopt proper methods to spray herbicides with the help of hi-tech machines so as to ensure efficient control of weeds at an early stage in the wheat crop. For this purpose, the department roped in the services of UPL Company for providing boom sprayers to spray these chemicals on the crops. The UPL provided 245 spray machines in the state, at least one in each block for the purpose. After its success on wheat crop, the same machines are now being used on the cotton crop. It costs Rs 90 per acre as spraying expenses against Rs 150 being spent by the farmers with the help of outsourced manual labour. The UPL authorities claim that the hi-tech machine helps in uniform spray with proper pesticide/herbicide and water ratio; it’s more effective as it uniformly covers every inch of field unlike the manual knapsacks and it amount to less loading of soil with agro chemicals. Several studies carried in the recent past by agro experts suggest that 40 to 50 per cent of the pesticide is wasted with manual spray, which not only adds to the cost of production, but also is environmentally hazardous and create imbalance in the natural ecosystem. This may be also attributed to non-awareness of the farmers and use of inefficient pesticide application machinery. Moreover, different types of sprayers, being used these days, do not hit the actual target. No sprayer is available that can hit the target under the cotton leaves where insects get protection. The boom sprayer also showers pesticide under the leaves.

With Saturday and Sunday being holidays, the House will reassemble on Monday and will adjourn sine die on Tuesday. The AAP and SAD-BJP combine have been attacking the state government for short duration of the session by describing it as ""mere farce"" and accusing it of running away from discussing Punjab's burning issues. They also demanded the speaker to extend the session. It will be interesting to see if Congress MLA from Amritsar East seat and former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu will attend the session.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Sidhu, who has been at loggerheads with Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, had resigned as minister from the Punjab cabinet last month after his portfolio was changed. Cricketer-turned-politician Sidhu, who continued to remain incommunicado for media, has been meeting his supporters at his residence in Amritsar. Except Congress MLAs Raj Kumar Verka and Pargat Singh, no other senior party leader or minister has met him post his resignation. Members of the Shiromani Akali Dali will be attending the session this time without party president Sukhbir Singh Badal, who has now become a Member of Parliament from Ferozepur seat. In his absence, senior Akali leaders Bikram Singh Majithia and Parminder Singh Dhindsa are likely to lead the charge to corner the treasury benches in the assembly. All eyes will also be on the faction-ridden Aam Aadmi Party and how effectively it raises its issues in the House, amid SAD's accusation that it is the ""B team"" of the ruling Congress. At present, AAP MLA Harpal Singh Cheema is the Leader of Opposition in Punjab Assembly.

"Ruchika M Khanna Tribune News Service Chandigarh, July 31 Being convened after the Budget session in February, mainly to fulfill the requirement of having one session within six months, the “five-day” monsoon session of the state Assembly, which begins on Friday, will practically have only two sittings. Taxpayers in Punjab will be shelling out a whopping Rs 70 lakh per day (totaling Rs 3.5 crore), for effectively two sittings that will be held. According to the schedule released by the Vidhan Sabha secretariat, the House will assemble on Friday for obituary references and will be adjourned.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Saturday and Sunday are holidays, following which it will reassemble on Monday morning and again on Tuesday, before being adjourned sine die. Information gathered by The Tribune reveals that the per day expense incurred on MLAs, police and other staff and on use of electricity and other operations is Rs 70 lakh (including Rs 1500 per day DA and TA at the rate of Rs 15 per km to MLAs). The Rule 14-A of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Vidhan Sabha mandates minimum 40 sittings in a year, but this has not been followed for the past several years. Oppn in disarray Meanwhile, all eyes will be on the Opposition parties, AAP and the SAD-BJP during the session. While AAP will be under scanner to assess its political future in the wake of constant rebellions and deep fissures in the legislative group, the SAD-BJP will be watched for who they elect as the leader of the alliance, after Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal won the election as Ferozepur MP. During the past six months, two AAP MLAs, Nazar Singh Manshahia and Amarjit Singh Sandoa, have resigned and switched loyalties to the ruling Congress. This takes the tally of rebel AAP MLAs to eight (including Sukhpal Singh Khaira, four MLAs in Kanwar Sandhu group and Baldev Singh), while another MLA HS Phoolka has resigned and is unlikely to attend the session. Aman Arora, Sunam MLA, too, is singing a different tune these days. All other nine rebels, however, will be attending the session and will be sitting alongside the 10 loyalist party legislators. Party sources say that since the last core committee meeting of the state unit held earlier this month, efforts are on to at least bring back four rebels -- Kanwar Sandhu, Pirmal Singh Khalsa, Jagdev Singh Kamalu and Jagtar Singh Jagga -- while trying to keep Arora in good humour. It remains to be seen if the efforts fructify. On the other hand, after Sukhbir’s election to Parliament and his resignation, the alliance is yet to decide on its leader. The sources say the names of Parminder Singh Dhindsa, Gurpartap Singh Wadala and Bikram Singh Majithia are doing the rounds. The Congress, comfortable in their recent win at the hustings, will be sitting in glory in the treasury benches. With not much time for debate (only two sittings are scheduled so far in the tentative plan released by the Vidhan Sabha), the ruling party’s focus will be on getting the legislative business done, including passing of important Bills like Punjab Land Leasing and Tenancy Bill, Punjab Transparency in Public Procurement Act; amendments to state civil services rules etc. Though there is much that the Opposition parties can corner the ruling party on, the attack may not be sharp enough because of the sheer majority the Congress has. The only sore thumb for the Congress could be former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, if he decides to attend the session. Sources close to the former firebrand minister, however, say that he is unlikely to attend.

Soon, it went to 40 feet and he had to spend thousands to get a new borewell, he added. Gurbachan Singh of Bhanua village near the Khera Kalmot mining area said almost every farmer in their village had to dug up a new borewell as the water level went down to more than 25 feet, which used to be 15 feet, and just 7 to 8 feet during monsoon. The experts in the Agriculture Department confirmed the concerns of farmers. Geologist Jaswant Singh said though no survey was conducted in this regard, farmers could be believed as earlier the riverbed was dug up to 10 feet and groundwater recharged through it used to maintain high levels in adjoining villages. “When a riverbed is dug up to 40 feet, water recharge starts from the same depth, leading to groundwater depletion. This has even led to groundwater pollution.” Jaspal said the digging up of the riverbed to such deep levels also punctured the acquifer (underground layer of water-bearing permeable rock) due to which one could notice groundwater emerging at mining spots. “The groundwater at such spots was run off with the river water, leading to further depletion. Moreover, the river water entering through the punctured acquifer polluted the groundwater,” he added. Plays havoc with water table   Illegal mining has played havoc with the water table in the district, with the riverbed being dug up to more than 40 feet.  Experts are of the opinion that the unchecked digging of the riverbed in the district has not only resulted in the depletion of water table in the adjoining areas but also in groundwater pollution.

"Ravi Dhaliwal Tribune News Service Dera Baba Nanak, July 14 With Pakistan finally agreeing to construct a 300-m-long bridge instead of a causeway till the International Border (IB), the threat of floods in Dera Baba Nanak town and its adjoining areas has subsided. Pakistan had been insisting on constructing a causeway in a low-lying area on its side till the IB, which will be a link with the bridge being established on the Indian side. A causeway, which is basically a road supported by earth or stone, does not allow water to pass under it because there would have been no space. In contrast, officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and Ceigall India Limited, a Ludhiana-based firm mandated with the corridor construction, have been demanding that a bridge should be established as it would allow the free flow of the Ravi water. The issue was first discussed a few months ago when BR Sharma, Special Secretary (Border Management), Ministry of Home Affairs, visited the corridor site. Cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and the NHAI officials had urged the Sharma to impress upon Pakistan the futility of constructing a causeway.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Randhawa, who is the Punjab Government’s pointsman to oversee the corridor’s construction in his capacity as Dera Baba Nanak MLA, said, “During monsoon, there would have been flood threat in the town because the causeway would have blocked the natural flow of water. Agreeing that the matter was indeed sensitive in nature, BR Sharma had agreed to take it up with the Pakistan government.” Jeetendra Singh, vice-president of the construction firm, claimed officials and locals heaved a sigh of relief when they learnt that the Pakistan government had agreed upon a bridge. “The details of the proposed bridge were shared between both countries. We informed them that the bridge coming up in our territory was 60 per cent complete. We intend to complete the corridor project by October 31,” Jeetendra added.  Officials and locals have heaved a sigh of relief…. We intend to complete the corridor by October 31. The causeway was adding to our concerns and we discussed the flood issue in informal meetings with Pakistan.

"Sandeep Dikshit Tribune News Service New Delhi, June 12 India will impress on Pakistan the need for a bridge over a creek in the path of the Kartarpur corridor in order to make pilgrimage to Gurdwara Nankana Sahib a round-the-year event. The differences of opinion over a bridge causeway are among the issues that Indian and Pakistani officials will attempt to thrash out at the second official round of talks on the Kartarpur corridor to be held at Wagah on Sunday. As the disagreement over the crossing for the 330-m creek of the Ravi may delay the connection, India is also set to propose an interim solution—of connecting the service roads on its bridge with the Pakistani road just above the creek level in order to get the corridor going by the time celebrations for Guru Nanak’s 550th birth anniversary begin in November. India is trying to persuade Pakistan to opt for a bridge also because land around Dera Baba Nanak may become vulnerable to flooding thereby leaving the pilgrims stranded.  “Causeways are not considered good engineering. Flooding in the monsoon is a concern,” said a government source.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Sources were confident that the two major works on the Indian side will be completed before the celebrations begin.  Final inspection of an airport-like passenger terminal with over 50 immigration counter will be held on October 31, while the road from the Gurdaspur-Dera Baba Nanak highway would have to be completed even earlier. The officials will also discuss the number of pilgrims to be permitted on daily basis, documents required for the purpose and the manner of journey to the gurdwara. Sources said India would deploy high-tech surveillance system and security apparatus.  “That is not negotiable,” sources added. Both sides have differences over the number of pilgrims allowed to go for darshan. India wants at least 5,000 pilgrims every day, while Pakistan has suggested only 750. The meeting will also see the Indian side reiterating its concerns over the active involvement of Khalistani sympathiser Gopal Singh Chawla in Pakistan’s preparations for the corridor project.

"Ruchika M Khanna Tribune News Service Chandigarh, July 11 The Punjab government is suffering a loss of Rs 600 crore each year on account of the Union government’s policy of cutting down on the coal allocation to the state. This is forcing the state to buy expensive imported coal, cost of which is running the state power utility dry. Realising how the cash-strapped state is losing money, the state government, led by Capt Amarinder Singh, has decided to take up the matter regarding the cut in coal supply with the Union government. Punjab will be demanding restoration of its original allocation of coal. Over the past one year, the coal supplied to the thermal power generation plants in Punjab (state owned as well as private generators) has come down from 6.6 million tonnes to 4.9 million tonnes. This has been done by Coal India Limited in accordance with the policy to allot coal as per the effective power generation capacity in a state. Since the two power plants — two units at Guru Gobind Singh Super Thermal Plant in Ropar and one unit at Guru Nanak Dev Thermal Plant in Bathinda — shut down, the total coal allocated to the state had been reduced. Also, when these three thermal power units were shut, the Congress government thought that the three private plants at Rajpura, Talwandi Sabo and Goindwal would start generating power at their optimum capacity. “However, the coal allocated to these three plants is also to meet just 75 per cent of their generation capacity,” said a senior official in the Power Department. Official sources in PSPCL have told The Tribune that these days when the demand of power is at unprecedented levels, especially in wake of a weak monsoon so far, the demand for generating power from the state’s own thermal plants as well as the three private plants had increased manifold. But the coal stocks available with the state are getting depleted and with replenishments not coming any time soon, the state has little option but to buy expensive power from producers outside Punjab.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });"

"Aman Sood Tribune News Service Patiala, July 7 Before the onset of every monsoon, villagers residing along the banks of the Ghaggar, a seasonal river, ensure that they have enough stock of ration and drinking water in case of floods. The Ghaggar terrorises hundreds of villages along its banks in three districts of Punjab. With the Irrigation Department yet to complete the repair of its banks and de-silting work, the villagers are on their toes fearing floods. It has been termed as the ‘River of sorrow’ due to the occasional floods it has caused in the past over a decade. Monsoon rains expected this week onwards have left the residents of nearby villages along the banks of the Ghaggar a worried lot. While the water level is below the danger mark as of now, villagers fear worst if it rains more in the coming few days. Villagers say that the work in certain areas is still to be carried out and in case of rising water level, fields and villages will bear the brunt. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });Floods during heavy monsoon are a regular norm in these areas with loss to both life and property after heavy inflow of water in the Ghaggar, which then floods nearby villages. While the district administration and Irrigation Department have started some de-silting work to clear its bed, heavy rains in the hills, coupled with illegal encroachments alongside its banks, are hampering the work. “We are never safe living here (near Ghaggar), but there is nothing much we can do other than crib. Politicians have come, announced to solve the problem many times but nothing concrete has been done. Floods can spoil our lives anytime during monsoon,” said Gurpreet Singh, a resident of Samana. “While Haryana has raised a concrete wall to save its villages, Punjab needs to do something similar to save its residents. The fear of floods always looms large on all the villages and in case of heavy rains, the damage would be too much to deal with,” he said. Flowing from the Shivalik hills, this seasonal river passes through the districts of Patiala, Sangrur and Mansa, where it causes maximum damage during monsoonal floods. In 2010, floods by this river had caused a huge loss to thousands of residents in Patiala and Sangrur. Already the Deputy Commissioners of Patiala and Sangrur are on toes to ensure that the 2010 situation is not repeated and work to clean the riverbed and strengthen its banks is on at full swing. “We have made ample arrangements to tackle any kind of situation in case of floods. I am personally supervising the last-minute repairs and essential works. The Irrigation Department was told in advance and they have taken ample steps to save our villages from floods,” said Patiala DC Kumar Amit. Meanwhile, even as the administration claims to have geared up for flood relief works, villagers are already prepared to shift their ration on the first floors of the houses in temporary kitchens. “This is an annual ritual where we shift our belongings and kitchen on the first floor,” said a villager. Irrigation Minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria said instructions had been passed to the Chief Engineer, Canals, for ensuring completion of necessary works in all drains and rivers in Punjab, which were flood-prone.

In the last two days, the rates have increased to Rs 15,000 for the same quantity. And in days to come, it is expected to reach anywhere up to Rs 25,000 per 950 ft of sand. People who are constructing houses/office premises are finding it difficult to buy sand at such exorbitant prices,” said the retailer. At the same time, he said, though government agencies had stopped digging sand but illegal digging would continue as ever.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); He said this was the time for illegal sand traders to get maximum returns. These persons continue with the digging of sand even from the beds of rivers. “And when raids are conducted, they flee leaving everything behind.

These persons then stock the sand and sell it to retailers/customers at hefty prices,” said the retailer in the Miller Ganj area. Sanjay Goel, Chiarman, IIA, Punjab Chapter, said the increase in rates of sand would cast impact on the construction business. “Those constructing small houses or shops, etc, will either slow-down with the construction or stop for the time being till the prices come down. As far as big buildings are concerned, they know that these three months, mines will be shut. They stock or make alternate arrangements so that work is not stopped. Moreover they use Pathankot sand (which one gets after crushing big stones) for big buildings due to its strength,” said Goel. May rise further   If retailers are to be believed, the rates are going to increase further in the coming days, putting those who are carrying out construction activities in a difficult situation. At the same time, it will not pose any difficulty to big builders, who use Pathankot sand (which is 60-70%costlier as it has more strength)."
"Arun Sharma Tribune News Service Ropar, July 2  Mining mafia digging riverbed around power supply towers near Anandpur Sahib has put Electricity Department officials on toes. It is apprehended that these towers with damaged foundations can be washed away during the monsoon and plunge nearly 150 villages into the dark. The officials are working day and night to make alternative arrangements so there is no major blackout in the area.  This has led to long and frequent power cuts in Nurpur Bedi villages. Irked over power cuts, locals have been staging protest almost every day.

As the demand of power started increasing, the area was being supplied 66 kv power through old power lines which used to create frequent faults. In order to overcome this problem, the department decided to lay a new power supply line for which new towers were installed. Three of these new towers were to be set up in the Sutlej riverbed near Sangatpur village. As soon as the foundations were laid for these towers, mafia dug up sand around their foundation. These foundations were washed away during the monsoon and officials abandoned the work of laying the new power line.  In December last year, it was noticed that the foundations of three old poles in the riverbed being used to supply power to these villages have also been exposed as the sand around these was dug out illegally.  Bhag Singh, SDO, said sand around the poles had been dug out and power could be disrupted during the monsoons if any of these poles were washed away. He said two new towers would be set up, one each on both sides of the river, so that the flooding of the river does not damages the towers. "

However, the entire season is expected to end on a deficit note. The rainfall in June will be 77 per cent (164 mm) of the LPA while it will be 91 per cent (289 mm) in July, 102 per cent (261 mm) in August and 99 per cent (173 mm) in September, as per Skymet. Skymet has said that paddy production is expected to reduce to 97.78 million tonnes this kharif season compared to 101.96 million tonnes in the previous season. It also said there is 40 per cent possibility of about 66 per cent districts in the country being deficient or largely deficient if the monsoon is ""below normal"".  Nandkumar expects about 100 districts, including those in Maharashtra's Vidarbha region, Telangana, Bihar and Jharkhand, to be rain deficient. — IANS"
"Anirudh Gupta Ferozepur, June 10 The discharge of thousands of cusecs of water into Pakistan from the Hussainiwala headworks has ruffled the farming community ahead of the paddy-sowing season. It has also contradicted the Central government’s stand in the aftermath of the Pulwama attack when Union Water Resources Minister Nitin Gadkari had declared that India would not allow any amount of its river water to flow into Pakistan. As per information, almost 14,000 cusecs water is being released into Pakistan from Hussainiwala, which the farmers term as total wastage of the natural resource. Karan Singh Dhaliwal, secretary, Border Kisan Union, said while some districts like Sangrur had been placed in the dark zone due to exploitation of groundwater, the release of water into Pakistan was unwarranted. Even Punjab Ekta Party leader Sukhpal Khaira had raised his concern over release of excess water across the border.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Meanwhile, sources in the drainage department said all three dams, including Bhakra, were filled to the brim. At Bhakra, while the inflow was recorded at 27,298 cusecs on Monday, the outflow was 35,000 cusecs. HS Chahal, Superintendent Engineer (Canals), Ferozepur, said water was being released into Pakistan as a preventive measure ahead of the monsoon season to avoid any untoward situation later. “We are gradually releasing the excess water so that there are no chances of flooding of the area as more inflow is expected in the coming weeks,” he said. “There is no option but to release this water into Pakistan,” said another department official, adding that if the water was not released, it might cause colossal damage in the coming days. Sanjeev Gupta, Chief Engineer (Drainage), said it was a high-alert situation as far as water in dams was concerned. “We cannot take chances as the situation might go out of control,” he said. Sources said earlier, the capacity of Hussainiwala headworks was about 4.5 lakh cusecs but due to presence of hyacinth and encroachment at some places along the Sutlej, the capacity had come down to almost one lakh cusecs over a period of time, which had compounded the problem."

"Anirudh Gupta Ferozepur, June 5 If you want arms licence, you need to plant at least 10 saplings in order to get your application processed. These are the latest orders of Deputy Commissioner Chander Gaind, who has taken the initiative to increase the green cover in the border district. “Now every arms licence applicant has to plant at least 10 saplings and take a selfie with the plantation as proof to submit with the application,” said the DC. “Having done the plantation, the applicants will have to bring pictures after an interval of 30 days with the growing up saplings planted by them to prove that they are taking care of the plants,” the DC said, adding that these pictures would have to be attached with the application file prepared for obtaining an arms licence. Thereafter the applications would be considered fit for granting the licence. Talking about the objectives behind the move, the DC said Ferozepur is among the districts having a large numbers of weapon licence holders with more than 20,000 arms licences issued so far. There are around 100 fresh applications, which are received every month for granting new weapon licences. Since the monsoon season is approaching and at this stage, the plantation is quite a crucial issue, so if every applicant plants 10 saplings, we will end up with thousand saplings planted every month, said the DC. If the applicants do not have their own land for plantation, the district administration would suggest some government land to such applicants. As the maintenance and care is an important part of plantation, all the applicants have to bring the pictures of growing plants after 30 days so that the nourishment of these plants can be ensured, said the DC, adding that after submitting plantation and post-plantation pictures along with the application the candidature of an applicant would be considered fit for the grant of a licence.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The applicants having immediate danger and threat to their life will get relaxation from the norms as they will get a weapon licence forthwith, but they have to furnish an undertaking of the plantation after receiving the licence.

"Ravi Dhaliwal Tribune News Service Dera Baba Nanak (Gurdaspur), May 27 The 4th ‘Technical Committee’ meeting on the Kartarpur corridor held between senior Indian and Pakistani officials at zero line on Monday has hit the bridge-causeway roadblock. While India suggested that an 800-metre bridge should be built on the Ravi, the Pakistani delegation, fearing flooding during the monsoon season which could erode the bridge, suggested the need to construct a causeway. During the last round of talks, the bridge-causeway dispute had surfaced and no breakthrough could be achieved. Even in today’s confabulations, talks had to be suspended as both sides struck to their respective stands. A causeway refers to a roadway supported mostly by earth or stone while a bridge supports a roadway between piers. The Ravi flows between the two borders.

It is credited with construction of bridges, roads, tunnels, airfields and dams in Pakistan. The road and other infrastructure being built by Pakistan on its side of the border are being supervised by the FWO.  The confabulations, which took place for nearly two hours, were held amid a tight security cover provided by BSF and Pakistani Rangers. Sources say the Pakistani side was apprehensive that excess water during the monsoons could endanger the proposed bridge and instead they wanted a causeway. Highly-placed sources claimed that if no headway is made then diplomats from both sides will step in to break the ice. Sources say the controversial issues pertaining to passport and visa requirements and the composition of the 10-member committee set up by the Pakistan Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee to screen visitors were not discussed as they “did not fall under the preview of the Technical Committee”. Punjab Cabinet Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, who supervised the land acquisition process for the corridor and the Integrated Check Post (ICP), today expressed optimism that the corridor would be completed by November when the 550th birth anniversary celebrations of Guru Nanak Dev commence. “The joint meetings are acting as a catalyst in getting the project completed on time.

"Aman Sood Tribune news service Patiala, November 25 Almost a year after they were first released into the Beas, gharials have “finally adapted to the new surroundings”. This was observed after the first post-monsoon survey.  The gharial hatchlings had been brought to Punjab from Morena (Madhya Pradesh). The survey was jointly conducted by the Department of Forest and Wildlife Preservation, Punjab and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)-India, along the 90-km stretch of the Beas, starting from Hargobindpur in Hoshiarpur district to Harike Headworks in Tarn Taran.

The first batch of gharials was released at Gagdewal village while two batches of gharials were later released at Wazir Bhullar village.  Capt Amarinder Singh had initiated the project during his first stint as Chief Minister from 2002-07.  Kuldip Kumar, Chief Conservator of Forests, Wildlife, and Chief Wildlife Warden of Punjab, said the Beas and its aquatic biodiversity, especially gharials and dolphins, had experienced the molasses spill in May and heavy rainfall and high flood levels in September and October. “However, it is satisfying to see that more than 50 per cent population of gharials was directly sighted in the survey.

The department also plans to increase the infrastructure and purchase other advanced equipment to better understand the ecology of aquatic animals at the Beas Conservation Reserve. Gitanjali Kanwar said the gharials were spotted basking on the mid-channel islands and quickly dispersed into water when approached. The gharials were active and showed no sign of sluggishness. “Observations showed that gharials have grown in size. Many were reported on the same islands which they selected as their habitat before the onset of monsoon,” she said. "
"Tribune News Service Chandigarh, November 12 Even as it has been scientifically proved that milk is getting contaminated due to pesticide-laden feed given to cattle, the state does not have any mechanism to regulate the quality of animal feed. There have been several moves in the past to exercise control, but all these failed to see the light of day due to various reasons. In August, the state Cabinet had passed The Punjab Regulation of Compounded Cattle Feed, Concentrates & Mineral Mixtures Act, 2018, but it was not introduced in the Vidhan Sabha’s monsoon session. Sources say the cattle feed industry doesn’t not want any regulatory mechanism.

Instead of harassing us, the government should control the use of pesticide in the farm sector,” said Ramesh Jain, president, Punjab Cattle Feed Manufacturers’ Welfare Association. Besides small village-level cattle feed mixing units, there are around 700 industrial units in the state. Earlier, the government had been taking action under the Punjab Regulation of Compounded Cattle Feed, Concentrates & Mineral Mixtures Order, 1988, which was issued under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955.

Since then there is no system in place to check the quality of feed. A study conducted by experts from Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (GADVASU), Ludhiana, has recently found that pesticide-laden cattle feed has been contaminating milk."
"Kuljit Bains Paddy in Punjab is as fascinating a subject as it is debilitating. From being responsible for sucking dry the earth in the state; to completely taking over the farmers’ idea of agriculture; destroying the state government’s finances; and now even skewing the Centre’s food economy; it is a story of contradictions in being the most popular crop that has even been rewarded with a substantial hike in the support price. The latest scam to surface of fake procurement has only painted a fresh coat of criminality on it. As reported in The Tribune on Sunday, false procurement of the crop has been shown on the online facility of food agencies with the connivance of arhtiyas, millers and government officials. It was a cosy arrangement between all characters involved, and therefore no one to raise a red flag. Even now only the tip of what may be an iceberg floating silently since years has been detected. While there is corruption in every conceivable activity that involves money, paddy is a particularly vulnerable target. For one, there is the huge volume of the commodity and money, and then there is the surfeit of agencies involved, from the arhtiya to the procurement official and the miller. All have a stake in joining hands to rob the farmer as well as the government. The most fundamental source of corruption – and a variety of other travails of the farmer – is the arhtiya. The irony is that this agent of misery is one entity that is completely superfluous to the system, and yet continues to succeed in portraying himself as indispensable. And arhtiyas have had the tacit support of government after government in the state, no matter what proposal of bypassing them is devised by the mother procurement agency, the Food Corporation of India. It is, of course, no surprise that many arhtiyas are also political creatures, or finance politics of the ruling party of the day. Their vice-like grip on farmers is best told in the sad tales of those committing suicide because of the huge debts owed to arhtiyas, who are running a virtual serfdom. The just-concluded season of paddy portrayed how completely the entire agriculture policy has tied itself in knots. Many well-intentioned interventions by the government ended up making it perhaps one of the most difficult Kharif seasons for farmers. It started with a delay in the permitted date of paddy transplantation to save water. Many farmers could not arrange the required short-duration seed variety. Then came the valid demand of not burning the crop residue, even if for a misplaced goal of preventing smog in Delhi, for which it is only peripherally responsible. But the requirement sent the farmers in a tizzy, with many struggling today to sow their next wheat crop in time to avoid suffering loss in that too. The delayed sowing of paddy has left the produce with high moisture content now, and the agencies don’t want to procure it, bringing angry farmers on the road. The monsoon that continued beyond date only added to the misery.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); That was only the farmers’ end. The governments’ – both state and Central – condition may be even worse because of paddy. Punjab is paying more than Rs 200 crore every month to the Centre towards what has been declared as dues (plus interest) on account of ‘missing paddy’, mostly procured during SAD-BJP rule. The latest scam unearthed may partly explain the missing paddy – it was perhaps never procured, but the price was paid. The consequences of growing paddy for the groundwater of Punjab and the tubewell bills paid by the state are only too well known to repeat. Yet, the mind-numbing irony is that paddy this year was rewarded with a massive jump in the support price, something neither the state government nor the farmer would object to. The Kharif prices have obviously disturbed the Centre’s finances, too, which is desperately looking to find ways to finance its development plans. The combined body of intellectuals of Punjab, the political leadership, even the farm leadership, and the bureaucracy, all need to hang their head in shame for not just letting the agro-economy to come to such a pass but, worse, continuing to promote it."
"Tribune News Service Chandigarh, October 10 The state government had set up a separate Department of Mines and Geology with much fanfare in April. But even after seven months, the government has failed to depute sufficient staff in the department. Out of 500 sanctioned posts, only 25 officials have been deputed. The idea behind carving out a separate unit from the Industries Department was to ensure better regulation of minor minerals being extracted from riverbeds and quarries. Information gathered by The Tribune reveals that other than four officers, one superintendent and four assistants, the department has hardly any staff at the head office here. Though 500 officials, including officers from the lining and drainage wing of the Irrigation Department, were deputed here, some of them got a stay from the court against their transfer.

Even these officers have not got salary since June when they were shifted to the new department. “This is because there is no administration branch set up at the secretariat or department level.

"Kulwinder Sandhu Tribune News Service Moga, September 25 The state Agriculture Department has advised farmers to drain out excess water from low-lying areas which got stagnated due to heavy rains in the past few days to prevent damage to cotton, paddy, maize and horticultural crops. Though moderate to heavy rainfall at the fag end of the monsoon season is good for paddy, it may lead to pest infestation in low-lying areas where water has accumulated. Jaswinder Singh Brar, Block Agricultural Officer, Sehna, Barnala district, said there has been a mixed impact of the ensuing rainfall on crops across the state. The farmers who had gone for early planting of paddy may suffer losses but overall, it will be beneficial for those who opted for late planting as per the government’s schedule. In some pockets of Punjab, the paddy crop is ready for harvest, he said. “As far as the cotton crop is concerned, the stagnated water in the fields is of no use. The farmers must look out for ways to drain out the excess water from the cotton fields because the crop is ready for harvest,” Brar said. The cotton-growing areas of Bathinda and Mansa districts got a good rainfall a couple of days back.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Brar said in the low-lying areas, the farmers need not worry provided more rains do not lash the region.

The excess water in most of the fields, except the low-lying areas, has evaporated to a great extent or has been absorbed in the soil. Meanwhile, the agriscientists have also claimed that the recent rainfall was good for kinnow-growers in Abohar, Malout and the adjoining areas.

"Tribune Reporters Chandigarh, September 22 Thanks to the widespread rain on Saturday and a similar prediction for the next two days, Punjab is likely to finish this monsoon with normal rainfall. It will be the first time since 2011 that the state will have a normal monsoon. With Saturday’s rain, the state has so far recorded 393.9 mm rainfall this season and till the fourth week of September, 468.1 mm is expected. The state was 16 per cent deficient, but according to the Chandigarh Meteorological Centre, the entire gap is likely to be filled with the current spell. The state had last witnessed a normal rainfall in 2011. At that time, it was 7 per cent above normal. Twelve districts have so far witnessed normal rainfall. It was deficient in six districts — Bathinda, Moga, Muktsar, Jalandhar, Amritsar and Kapurthala — and scanty in Mansa, Fazilka and Ferozepur. Ropar district witnessed excess rainfall with around 1,000 mm so far.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The current spell of rain will start receding on Monday, while some isolated places will receive heavy rainfall. A drop in both day and night temperatures was recorded. The maximum temperature fell to 32 degree Celsius and the minimum was 22°C. Meanwhile, farmers have said that the current spell of rain will prove harmful for paddy. Jagmohan Singh, state general secretary of BKU (Dakaunda), said those who had sown short-term varieties of paddy would suffer the most as the harvest had already started reaching the market. He said the discolouration of  high-quality basmati would affect crop prices. The ongoing showers will also delay harvest, he added. “There have been no case of crop damage so far, but if it continues to rain incessantly tomorrow and strong winds blow, then it can result in major crop damage,” said Baldev Singh Latala, state vice-president of the All India Kisan Sabha. In Malwa, cotton farmers are a worried lot, apprehending crop loss due to incessant rain. Though the area under cotton cultivation came down in Malwa this year, the farmers were expecting a bumper yield. However, with the forecast of heavy rain in the state for three days just around the harvesting time, they fear the worst now.  The cotton had started arriving in the market in areas such as Fazilka and the farmers were upbeat, as their produce was already fetching a price of above Rs 5,800 per quintal. Agriculture experts have advised the farmers not to irrigate their fields in view of the rainfall, as it increases the threat of flattening of crops, if strong winds accompany the rainfall. Earlier this year, the government had raised the MSP of cotton from Rs 4,020 to Rs 5,150 per quintal. Kamal Deep Singh, a farmer from Jalandhar district, said most of the paddy sown on nearly 1,500 acres had got submerged. “We have been asking district officials to provide pump sets for draining out water. It seems unlikely that the standing crop will survive if it continues to rain till Sunday morning.” In Patiala, the district administration is keeping a close watch on the water level in the Ghaggar.

"Aman Sood Tribune News Service Patiala, September 10 For poor air quality in the state, farmers usually take the blame for causing it by resorting to stubble-burning. However, a perusal of the data based on the monthly Air Quality Index, collected from six air monitoring stations across the state, reveals a different story. It shows that the air quality in the state was never in the “good” category and rarely in “satisfactory”. It was rather “poor” or “very poor” during the first six months of this year. There was no stubble-burning during this period, which usually takes place in October. While 0-50 microgram per cubicmetre (µg/m³) RSPM (respirable suspended particulate matter) is considered good, 51-100 satisfactory, 101-200 moderate, 201-300 poor, 301-400 very poor and 401-500 severe. The average air quality in the first six months of this year was recorded between moderate to poor with sometimes reaching “very poor” category due to dust storms and other factors.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Depleting forest cover in the state has further added to the woes. At present, the Punjab Pollution Control Board records air quality at monitoring stations in Patiala, Amritsar, Mandi Gobindgarh, Khanna, Jalandhar and Ludhiana. Charanjit Singh, a senior PPCB official, said: “Usually the reading is above 100 RSPM on most days, but goes on to alarming levels when farmers resort to stubble-burning or when we have dust storms. The other major reason for the high pollutants in the air is the declining forest cover in the state.” “During winters, the burning of wood as fuel for cooking and crackers also add to pollution in addition to low air velocity, while in summer months, dust storms are the major reason,” he claimed. In October and November last year, the air quality had turned “very poor” following farm fires and bursting of crackers, with the RSPM reaching around 340 µg/m³, causing smoggy conditions. Many schools in the districts were asked to shut down due to smog. Another senior PPCB official said industrial and vehicular pollution and smoke emanating from brick-kilns usually continued throughout the year and made the matters worse. “What is now worrying is the flow of air laden with dust and other particles and less rain spells during the pre-monsoon period. Further, pollens also worsen the air quality in addition to construction-related activity,” he said.  What is particulate matter Particulate matter (PM) is a complex mixture consisting of varying combinations of dry solid fragments, solid cores with liquid coatings and small droplets of liquid. It may be divided into many size fractions, measured in microns (a micron is one-millionth of a metre). ARB regulates two size classes of particles - particles up to 10 microns (PM10) and particles up to 2.5 microns in size (PM2.5). PM2.5 particles are a subset of PM10  PPCB in denial mode  In May 2016, the PPCB had trashed as ‘dubious’ the WHO report showing four Punjab cities — Ludhiana, Khanna, Amritsar and Mandi Gobindgarh — among the world’s 25 most-polluted cities in terms of fine particulate matter-2.5 level in the air. Again in May 2018, the PPCB had termed the figures quoted in a WHO report on 20 most-polluted cities as “fudged and unscientific”. Patiala had figured at 13th spot on the list. "

"Jupinderjit Singh Tribune News Service Chandigarh, August 24 Infighting in the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) took centre stage on the first day of the monsoon session of the Vidhan Sabha on Friday. Former Leader of Opposition Sukhpal Khaira and seven other MLAs of his rebel group chose to sit in the back row after an initiative to resolve differences between the warring groups failed. Speaker Rana KP Singh told The Tribune that he would decide on the seating arrangement for Khaira on Monday as there was disagreement within the party. Leader of Opposition Harpal Cheema had written to the Speaker on Thursday, changing Khaira’s seat.

During Cheema’s meeting with party MLAs before the session, they agreed that the seat plan should not be an issue. Meanwhile, Phoolka wrote to the Speaker, offering his seat to Khaira. The Speaker did not accept it, saying that it was the prerogative of the Leader of Opposition to request a change of seats of his party’s MLAs. When the session began, the Khaira group came separately and sat at the rear. Phoolka went up to Khaira and managed to bring him to the front row, where the latter sat for a few minutes.

"Ruchika M Khanna & Rajmeet Singh Tribune News Service Chandigarh, August 23 Moneylenders in Punjab will now have to seek a licence from the state authorities to lend money on interest rates fixed by the government. The Punjab Government also proposes to fix the cash limit on loans given per unit of land by the private lenders, mainly commission agents (arhtiyas). The arhtiyas are often accused of charging interest as high as 24 per cent per annum while banks charge only 4 per cent on crop loans up to Rs 3 lakh, if repayment is on time. Punjab is plagued with rural indebtedness with farm loans from  institutional sources pegged at Rs 82,000 crore and from arhtiyas at Rs 20,000 crore.      The decision to regulate non-institutional loans to help debt-trapped farmers was made at a meeting of the Punjab Cabinet on Thursday.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The new provisions have been included as amendments in the Punjab Settlement of Agricultural Indebtedness Act, 2016, which will be tabled in the monsoon session of the Vidhan Sabha that begins on Friday.  Once these are passed by the House, loans will be deemed as ‘already paid’ to moneylenders in cases where the interest paid by farmers/farm labourers on the loan availed is equal to the principal amount. Registration of moneylenders is mandatory under the Punjab Money-Lenders Act, 1938.  Official sources say till a few years ago, most moneylenders would apply for a licence, which would be issued by collectors. The Act, valid not only for arhtiyas but also traders lending money privately, provides that any suit for recovery filed by unregistered moneylenders will not be entertained.  Over the years, the arhtiyas stopped applying for a licence on the plea that they gave money to farmers against crops sold through them, unlike any other non-institutional financial concerns.   Vishwajeet Khanna, Additional Chief Secretary, Development, told The Tribune that the aim was to regulate private moneylenders and provide quick relief to the ailing farm sector. “A Cabinet sub-committee was formed last year to study the 2016 Act, which made certain recommendations. Moneylenders cannot lend more than the farmers’ paying capacity.  “We have amended Section 5 of the Punjab Settlement of Agricultural Indebtedness Act, 2016, which paves the way for establishing Debt Settlement Tribunals at the divisional level rather than the district level (as originally proposed in the 2016 Act),” he said.

"Ruchika M Khanna Tribune News Service Chandigarh, July 22 Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal has opposed the Centre’s “hasty framing of laws” related to the Goods and Services Tax (GST), touted by the saffron party as its biggest economic reform. According to him, the move is bound to invite immense litigation. Manpreet was the only one to have raised an objection in the GST council meeting held in Delhi on Saturday. Although he wanted to get finance ministers of other non-BJP ruled states on board, ministers of West Bengal and Kerala and even Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy, who holds the finance portfolio, were not present. Manpreet also raised concerns over “neglecting” of the recommendations of the Law Review Committee.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); “The recommendations were not shared with the states. We should be allowed to study these first, before the matter is taken in the council meeting,” Manpreet told The Tribune, adding that he was not there for the entire session of the meeting and “had to leave to reconcile with my disappointment at rushing through of the GST law”. On Sunday, he shot off a letter to Union Minister Piyush Goyal (who is heading the Finance Ministry), saying that the GST law in its present form has too many aberrations that need immediate correction, some from retrospective effect. It further says that the process of correction should be done by involving all stakeholders, including taxpayers. “The process should be adequate, fair and transparent so that the need to go back to legislatures at frequent intervals is avoided,” it reads. Manpreet has also objected to the fact that the work done by the Law Review Committee is being ignored “to get some select amendments passed during the monsoon session of Parliament. Of the 69 amendments recommended by the committee, only eight have been accepted without changes and 15 with changes, while the remaining 46 have been ignored,” reads the letter. Manpreet said the “extremely brief consultation does not repose confidence” for such kind of legislation. “The process adopted for the finalisation of the GST law also impinges upon the state’s right of proper representation before we take up this legislation in our legislatures for approval,” he added. Notably, before the GST Council meet, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on July 1, raising concerns about the recommendations of Law Review Committee not being shared with states and being ignored in the council."

Traditionally, farmers were following maize-wheat or sugarcane-maize-wheat cropping pattern. But during the last four decades they shifted to wheat-rice cropping pattern leading to increased demand for irrigation water. “There were only 1.92 lakh shallow tube wells in the state during 1970.

The challenge before us is not only to repopulate the fish but to also ensure the survival of dolphins and gharials. They will have little choice but to eat other organisms.

Deputy Director of Fisheries Department Raj Kumar said seeds of rohu, catla and mrigal were available in government-run fish farms, whereas seeds of cat fish like singhara, malhi, chital and sole would have to be arranged from fish farms located in West Bengal and the southern side. Though no commercial fishing, netting or hunting in the conservation area between Harike and Karmuwala is allowed, the Fisheries Department has recommended a blanket ban on the same in the Beas river for the next two years so that the progenies could prosper."

He said, “Using cloud technology, a maths or science teacher in Ludhiana can simultaneously deliver a lecturer to students in a Tarn Taran school where there is no teacher.” He added, “We intend to set up a lab in Mohali if the state government provides us infrastructure. It will help the government save the expenditure on setting up computer labs in various schools, besides monitoring attendance.”"
"Arun Sharma Tribune News Service Ropar, March 1 While the successive governments failed to provide proper connectivity to people in the state for long, Sikh saint Baba Labh Singh (Kila Anandgarh) at Anandpur Sahib has brought succour to lakhs of people by building seven bridges in Punjab and Haryana. His efforts to provide easy connectivity to villages have earned him the sobriquet of “Pulanwala Baba”. While six bridges built by the Baba are already operational, the seventh such bridge, costing Rs 10 crore, will be opened for public at Shahpur Bela village, near Kiratpur Sahib, on Saturday. The 600-ft-long and 18-ft-wide bridge will bring succour to 400 residents, who till now were using a boat provided by the Irrigation Department in the name of connectivity with the main road during rainy season.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The Sutlej branches out near the village, merging again on the other side, turning the village into an island during monsoon. “We send our children and expectant women to other villages during monsoon to avoid mishap in case of an emergency,” said Kulwinder Singh, a local resident. Sarpanch Davinder Singh, recalling the miseries of villagers, said seven years ago a local girl had died when she could not be taken to hospital in time due to flood in the river. Gurdeep Kaur had suffered a heart attack. Trapped in the village, she died in the absence of medical attention. Three years ago, the only boat available in the village capsized, putting life of several children in danger who were going to school, said Bali Singh, a retired school headmaster. Facing these problems and government apathy, the villagers met the Baba, who readily agreed to build a bridge. Now the bridge has been built by the Baba and the government must lay metalled road from the bridge till Bunga Sahib-Nurpur Bedi road, villagers demanded. Foreman Kamaldev, who look after all the construction work starting from the design of the bridge, said two years ago a 670 ft bridge at nearby Burj village was opened for public on February 13, 2016, reducing the distance between several villages and Anandpur Sahib from 22 to a mere 7 km. Earlier five such bridges — four on the Sutlej in the surrounding areas of Anandpur Sahib and one over the Ghaggar in Fatehabad district of Haryana — were built by him without any help from the state governments. Providing better connectivity, however, is not the only social work being done by the Baba, he has built buildings of 29 schools, including government schools. He has organised marriages of over 500 girls from poor families. Shelter is provided to nearly 1,000 people, including patients and their attendants, at a gurdwara being run by Baba Labh Singh at the PGI, Chandigarh. "
"Perneet Singh Tribune News Service Bathinda, February 13 Cotton production in the state is unlikely to meet the estimated figure of 12 lakh bales this year and may fall short by 1 lakh to 1.5 lakh bales due to inclement weather and low availability of canal water. Talking to The Tribune, former North India Cotton Association president Ashok Kapur said, “Initially, it was estimated that the state’s cotton production will touch 12 lakh bales this year. However, as the season proceeded, the estimates were revised and now we are hoping that it will be somewhere between 10.5 lakh and 11 lakh bales.” He attributed the higher estimates at the start of the season to the fact that the area under cotton cultivation had gone up considerably in the state. Overall, the area under cotton cultivation in the state had increased from 2.56 lakh hectares to 3.83 lakh hectares. In Bathinda, it shot up from 97,000 hectares to 1.3 lakh hectares, from 32,000 hectares to 64,608 hectares in Muktsar and from 67,000 hectares to 86,000 hectares in Mansa.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); According to him, the cotton production of the region, including Punjab, Haryana and Ganganagar circle of Rajasthan, is likely to be around 45 lakh bales. Out of this, Haryana will account for 24 lakh bales and Ganganagar circle for 10 lakh bales. He hoped that the state’s farmers would continue cotton farming in the next season as well, as they got remunerative prices for their produce, which touched Rs 5,500 per quintal mark this season. Dr GS Romana, senior farm economist, PAU, said, “Cotton production may have been hit this time, as weather conditions were not conducive for it. The entire month of July was almost dry and the monsoon got delayed, which prompted the farmers to irrigate their crop more. Besides, it came to our notice that some farmers also used tubewell water, which is brackish, during pre-sowing irrigation. We don’t recommend this as high temperature coupled with brackish water leads to cotton burning.” He, however, felt that the state has done fairly well in terms of cotton production this year. On the other hand, though farmers are more or less satisfied with the prices cotton fetched, they say it failed to meet their expectations. “We were expecting that the cotton prices will at least cross Rs 6,000 per quintal mark, but it barely managed to touch Rs 5,500. Besides, the low yield too has taken a toll on our returns,” said Jagtar Singh, a farmer from Naruana village. At present, the cotton prices are hovering between Rs 5,200 and Rs 5,300 per quintal."

"Our Correspondent  Abohar, January 14 No action has been taken to clear encroachments from three of the four ponds at Kandhwala Amarkot village near Abohar despite Rural Development and Panchayat Minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa issuing instructions on July 1 last year in this regard. The water overflowing from the lone remaining pond is causing pollution with dirty water threatening to enter houses.  Bajwa had also ordered the proper maintenance of the ponds for their proper utilisation. The minister had told officials to restore the status quo ante after getting the records from the Revenue Department. Pond land was to be marked on the basis of records and encroachments, if any, were to be removed.  (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });Bajwa said that due to the encroachments, there were no outlets for drainage in the villages, resulting in quarrels over stagnant dirty water. The Punjab and Haryana High Court had in February 2014 directed the state government to submit a report against encroachers on government/panchayat land as ordered by Supreme Court in 2011. The SC had directed all states and UTs to evict illegal/unauthorised occupants of gram sabha/gram panchayat/ shamlat land and restore land to the panchayats for the common use of villagers. Information reveals that 125 acres of pond land in Abohar sub-division was allegedly encroached upon mostly by political activists having allegiance to SAD and BJP during the past decade. Sarpanch of Kandhwala Amarkot village and some other members had in March last year requested authorities to demarcate the encroachments and to take action against the encroachers.  The panchayat said only one out of four ponds was free of encroachments and it needs to be cleaned immediately to prevent overflowing. In March last year, some houses on encroached land in Khuyiansarwer village were demolished. As many as 170 families had raised illegal structures over the dry ponds, resulting in flooding of adjoining areas during monsoon. The area earmarked for ponds was 68 kanal as per panchayat record, but hardly 25 per cent of it was free of encroachments. A similar problem plagues most villages, including Jandwala Meerasangla located near the international border. "
"Ravi Dhaliwal Tribune News Service Dera Baba Nanak, January 7 A flood threat looms large over Dera Baba Nanak town following the changed course of the Ravi over the last few years. This is due to the construction of spurs and dykes by Pakistan on its side of the border. Spurs and dykes are structures that protect river banks and thwart flood waters. They are built using stones and wire. The situation has now reached a flashpoint. Experts opine that if spurs are not constructed on the Indian side before the onset of the monsoon in June, there is every danger that the waters can wash away Dera Baba Nanak town, 8 km away.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); A drainage department team, led by Chief Engineer Adarsh Kumar Bansal, visited the area near Chandu Wadala village where a lot of soil erosion has already taken place.

"The ugly spat between a Patiala mining officer, sand mafia and the police on Nov 19 shockingly revealed the govt’s failure to curb illegal mining. The Tribune team last week spread out to make a random check on the extent of the loot of the state’s natural resource. What stood out was the ease with which it is done Patiala With political backing, no fear Despite the Vigilance Bureau (VB) highlighting illegal mining near the Ghaggar riverbed, business is thriving as officers in the district have turned mute spectators in the face of a strong politically backed lobby. Despite police raids, rarely is anyone arrested. And if someone does get arrested, no inquiry follows. Mining that goes on with suspected collusion of the local police and irrigation officials has led to environmental degradation, leading to floods in the monsoon. The mafia is allegedly backed by an MLA, who also doubles as a contractor, or asks his aides to take construction contracts in the area. “Henchmen then plunder the Ghaggar and deliver to construction sites without paying tax,” one person involved in mining told The Tribune. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); In a letter written on November 9, the VB had specifically asked the Patiala police and the departments of Irrigation and Mining to check illegal mining in the Ghaggar. While the police did not do anything, a mining officer was harassed and allegedly assaulted by the cops, who ideally should have acted against illegal mining. A typical example of the police letting such operators go was witnessed earlier this year when the Ghagga police got a tip-off pertaining to mining and caught one suspect along with a JCB machine at Darouli village. The person arrested was Nirvair Singh, a resident of Darouli. The police registered an FIR under Section 379 of the IPC and the Mines and Minerals Act against Nirvair Singh and two others, Sarabjit Singh and Harjinder Singh, at Ghagga police station, while the JCB was impounded. Nine months later, the suspects are free, as they submitted an application seeking an inquiry by a senior officer despite the fact that one inquiry had found them guilty, said Ghagga SHO Parmeet Singh. According to locals, even under the present government, SHOs wait for “orders from their political bosses” before taking action. “We cannot do much as local leaders are usually behind it, and senior officials are aware of the goings-on,” an SHO who has earlier been posted in one such police station told The Tribune.— Aman Sood JALANDHAR No mining official, sand is gold With not even a single mining official posted in Jalandhar for the past several years, sand mafia here has been able to turn sand into gold. A Tribune visit to villages across the 85-km stretch from Panj Dhera village in Phillaur to Mehatpur, Shahkot, Malsian, and to Gidderpindi village in Kapurthala, revealed a majority of the villages to be hotbeds of illegal mining. A farmer in Mallu Machhi village of Sultanpur Lodhi, where Jalandhar, Kapurthala and Ferozepur districts meet, said sand operators had purchased land close to auctioned quarries, and were carrying on illegal mining in over 200 acres there. “Local villagers, too, have become part of the well-oiled network by providing cheap labour and transportation,” the farmer, who did not want to be identified, said. He said an authorised quarry contractor ‘sells’ an original gate pass for anything between Rs 3,000 and Rs 5,000 to illegal operators, which provides the latter impunity from any check on the way. These operators pay another Rs 500 to Rs 1,200 per vehicle to landowners and make multiple rounds for lifting sand on a single receipt, without crossing the weighbridge. The sand is ultimately sold for Rs 9,000 to Rs 13,000. Mukesh Khanna, General Manager (Industries-cum-Mining Officer), Jalandhar, said illegal activity was not rampant in the area. But The Tribune team saw mining being done openly in Qaimwala and Khurlapur villages in Nakodar and in the Beas near Shahkot. A government contractor at Pipli village was found to be in possession of the GM’s official stamp, which he was using to ‘produce’ genuine receipts. When contacted, the GM said, “I am not aware how my stamp has reached Pipli, especially when there is no need for a stamp on the computer-generated receipt.”— Rachna Khaira Amritsar Illegal trucks ruin village peace With only six quarries having been allotted out of 14 in the district, sand mining is continuing illegally in full swing. Ajnala subdivision, with nine quarries, is known for its fine sand from the Ravi riverbed. Baba Bakala subdivision’s Beas area has five quarries. A resident of Balarwal village in Ajnala, who is involved in the trade, said with the change in government, only those operating at the top had changed, while the operations on the ground continued as earlier. A quarry in Ajnala’s Sarngdev village is yet to be allotted, but The Tribune saw mining going on there unhindered. Locals say the operation starts late in the evening and continues till the morning to escape attention. Sarngdev is a village bustling with 50 shops. It has pucca link roads, but residents are angry over trucks carrying illegally mined sand ruining their peace. The trucks are a safety hazard; they also damage the roads. Farmers are permitted to excavate their fields not more than 10-ft deep, but they are also involved in mining the ‘minor mineral’ beyond permitted levels. Ajnala SDM Rajat Oberoi said a team of officials from various departments, including Irrigation, Drainage, Forest and Mining, had been formed. They took action whenever illegal mining was detected. Cases were also registered under the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act against farmers exceeding the digging limit. District Mining Officer Bhola Singh Brar said over 100 FIRs had been lodged in connection with illegal mining this year.— Neeraj Bagga Ferozepur As sun sets, it’s time to get busy Illegal sand mining continues unabated in the border district of Ferozepur. As the sun sets, dozens of tippers and tractor-trailers loaded with sand move out in various directions from mines being operated clandestinely. Most of the activity takes place along the Sutlej belt, especially in Zira, Guruharsahai and Mamdot areas. The entire business, though illegal, is carried out in an organised manner, with shares of all stakeholders, including operators and contractors, fixed. More than 500 cases under various sections of the IPC and the Mining and Minerals Development Act, 1957, have been registered to date this year. Besides, more than Rs 10 crore has been slapped as penalty by the district administration. Over two dozen JCBs, Poclain machines and other equipment worth crores have also been confiscated. There are 35 approved sites for mining in Ferozepur district, of which 33 are operational. However, the number of illegal sites is much more. Faridkot district has only three authorised sites for sand mining — in Arianawala, Jand Sahib and Doad villages. While there was no report of illegal mining there, contractors are digging much below the approved level. In Muktsar district, occasional illegal mining from canals and minors has been reported.— Anirudh Gupta, Balwant Garg and Archit Watts Jagraon Mining without approval Though the government has not auctioned any site for mining in Sutlej in the Sidhwan Bet area, it goes on unchecked in some villages, particularly Gorsian Khan Mohammad and Bhundri. According to sources, the mafia has been excavating around 100 tippers (trucks) of sand every day from the riverbed near the two villages. “A truck carries around 1,000 cubic ft of sand with a market value of around Rs 30,000. Residents of Gorsian Khan Mohammad village say the practice has been going on for a long time, and most of the work is done at night. A visit to the spot revealed heavy machines, including excavators and JCBs, mining and loading sand on to trucks. Sources said the operators had hired musclemen who threatened villagers if they objected to the mining. Link roads of the area have also been damaged by the trucks. Amarjit Bhatia, GM, Mining Department, Ludhiana, claimed he was not aware of illegal mining in the Sidhwan Bet area. Regarding mining near Gorsian Khan Mohammad village, he claimed it was being done at the authorised Kaimbad site, and the contractor was only supplying sand to Ludhiana through the village.— Jaswant Shetra Ropar Cutting into riverbank The mining mafia in the district plunders with impunity, with neither the change of government nor action by the administration able to slow them down. Two weeks ago, DC Gurneet Tej recommended the cancellation of lease of the Baihara quarry after an inquiry panel found digging of the riverbed to a depth of 18 ft against the limit of 10 ft. Yet, last week, machines could be seen busy at work in the Swarah quarry in the Soan river. While giving environmental clearance for the quarry in an area of 62.69 hectares, the permitted working depth was fixed at 10 ft. To maintain safety and stability of the river bank, 3 metre, or 10 per cent of the width of the river, whichever is more, was declared a no-mining zone. However, material has been dug up to the banks, even baring roots of trees. AAP leader and local MLA Amarjit Singh Sandoa alleged that the mining mafia were active all over the district, including in Chandpur, Agampur, and Purkhali. He had met officials concerned several times, but to no effect, he alleged. Chiman Lal Garg, Mining General Manager, denying laxity, claimed that officials were sent immediately to the spot on every complaint. He said department officials had to work hard as they had less than 50 per cent of the required staff.— Arun Sharma"
"Tribune News Service Chandigarh, November 26 Contaminated water, erratic power supply and lack of sewerage continue to be the bane of border area residents. Dala village, 10 km from the wire fencing in Gurdaspur district, is symptomatic of villages near the Zero Line. Notwithstanding tall claims by the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), supply is erratic that has a cascading effect on basic utilities such as drinking water. Villagers spend huge sums on sinking deep bore tubewells and install diesel-operated pumpsets just to get drinking water. “One has to sink a bore well at 300 ft. And even at this depth, we get uncontaminated water. This means an expense in excess of Rs1 lakh,” a villager says. “People in this belt own small landholdings. They get a bore well dug for Rs20,000 to Rs30,000 at 60 to 70 ft and then install an RO system,” says Harpreet Dala.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The PSPCL claims it supplies uninterrupted power. The connections of waterworks are snapped when panchayats default on their bills, it says. Recently, strong winds uprooted or broke poles. The staff struggled to get things back on track for 48 hours. Villagers have a solution: they want the PSPCL to lay underground cables. Officials, however, claim they do not have the money to do so. Also, pipes from water tank to homes remain broken. Officials find it tedious to repair them in border areas. “The Punjab Rural Water Supply and Sanitation project (Phase-1), financed by the 16th World Bank Mission during the Badal’s rule spent money on improving the water supply mechanism in border villages, but the purpose was defeated by erratic power supply. Unless uninterrupted electricity is given to waterworks, the money will go down the drain,” a department official says. Tarn Taran Brackish water worries villagers   The border villages of Valtoha and Bhikhiwind are referred to as ‘khara Majha’, for their brackish underground water. In 40 villages, including Badharwal, Bhaini, Baserke, Chak Bamb, Hundal, Rajoke, Kambo Ke, Mari, Madar and Wan Tara Singh, people prefer to fetch water from hand pumps installed by the Water Supply and Sanitation Department. Satnam Singh of Hundal village says the hand pumps draw water from a depth of 550 ft. “Though waterworks have been constructed in several villages, but power supply is erratic. Many households do not have water connections.” Officials of the department claim that a survey to link more villages with the water supply chain is in progress and more waterworks are being constructed. Farmers have a reason to worry as they claim that the poor quality of underground water is affecting soil health. Most of the canal minors have already collapsed due to lack of upkeep and farmers are dependent on groundwater for irrigation. The collapse of water supply channels has also affected the disposal of waste water. With no underground sewerage, villagers have been dumping waste in overflowing ponds. At Pahuwind village, the area around Government Primary School is used for disposing of waste water. Fazilka Water filters not good enough    Reverse Osmosis (RO) water filter plants have been ineffective in border villages of the district. In Kheowali Dhab, the native village of former minister Kanshi Ram Rinwa, no one fetches water from an RO plant. A resident, Prithvi Raj, says RO plants draw groundwater, which contains a lot of impurities caused by waterlogging. The population in Kheowali Dhab and Lakhewali Dhab villages exceeds 4,000. They depend on waterworks run by the Public Health and Sanitation Department on a rotation basis, but have to compromise on water quality. “We prefer to pay Rs250 to Rs300 for each container that carries water from Gang (Bikaner) canal and use it to wash clothes and utensils,” says another villager. Rinwa had, in 1978, shown farsightedness in linking the village pond to a small drain that empties in Shehtirwala drain. But over time, encroachments have hampered the water flow. Jandwala Meerasangla village was in the news when a squall wreaked havoc in February 2003. Former sarpanch Bhagwan Dass claims that the government released funds to rebuild the village. But ground situation tells a different story. A 2,000-ft pipeline, which was laid to drain out water from the ponds, release water in 25 per cent of houses as no other outlet is available. There are few takers for RO water as many of the plants are located near public toilets. Villagers demand that RO plants should source water from canals which do not contain as many impurities as underground water. Ferozepur Streets, drains not a priority here  The SAD-BJP government doled out huge sums of money on the development of basic amenities in rural areas, but there little has changed on the ground. In Bhanewala, Jalloke, Rajoke Gatti, Kaluwala, Chandiwala, Khunder Gatti, Kamale Wala and Bhakhra villages, residents’ concern is not power or water, but the lack of sewerage. Malkit Singh of Gatti Rajo Ke village says, “Because of open drains, the condition is unbearable during the monsoon. The drains are flooded and so are the streets.” Water-borne diseases and other ailments are rampant. In some villages, sewerage pipes leak — sewage often flows into water pipes, he adds. Ajit Singh, the sarpanch of the village, says funds have not been received for sewerage. “A few years ago, we received funds for the construction of streets,” he said. The Department of Water Supply and Rural Sanitation has constructed waterworks, but many panchayats have been asked to fend for themselves. The absence of street lights is another concern. “It is difficult for elderly persons to roam in the village after dusk,” says Bagga Singh. The administration got solar lights installed last year, but none of them are functional, said Bittu of Tendiwala village. Amritsar High arsenic content  High concentration of arsenic in underground water is the bane of Amritsar district. Tests by several agencies have recorded the highest concentration of arsenic in the district of Punjab. Ask officials of the Department of Water Supply and Sanitation (DWSS) and they simply claim that drinking water is supplied to all villages of the district. They don’t talk about the arsenic content. And they do not have an action plan to address the problem. Of the 878 villages in the district, 391 face water quality issues. In all, 338 villages have high concentration of arsenic in underground water. A large number of residents of borders villages in Ramdas, Ajnala and Attari blocks are dependent on hand pumps and submersible pumps. The overhead water supply tanks in many villages have been lying defunct. Ramandeep Singh of Granthgarh village says, “The residents in small villages beyond the Ravi and those living in behaks (farmhouses) do not have water supply connections.” The DWSS had laid sewerage in three villages of the district under a World-Bank-aided project. There is no state scheme for sewerage in villages. The inhabitants of border villages are generally concerned with power supply during the paddy season. In spite of tall claims of surplus power, uninterrupted supply is a distant dream for residents here. Rattan Singh, a farmer union leader, says: “We have to gherao the subdivisional offices of the PSPCL to get eight-hour of supply for tubewells every year. Unscheduled cuts are the order of the day, even in winters.” Inputs by Ravi Dhaliwal, Manmeet Singh Gill, Raj Sadosh, Anirudh Gupta and Charanjit Singh Teja"

"Tribune News Service Chandigarh, November 2 Education is in a shambles in villages of Punjab’s border belt. Vacancies have not been filled for years, defying the guidelines of the Right to Education (RTE) Act. The less said about infrastructure the better. Of the 16 education blocks in Gurdaspur district, eight are located along the border with Pakistan. The staff strength is skeletal in these blocks. At Bhalonwali village middle school in Fatehgarh Churian block, there is just one teacher who teaches all subjects to 50 students. At Rattan Abdal village high school, Dera Baba Nanak, there are three teachers for 145 students. Amarjit Shastri, a union leader, said petty politics had ruined the education system. “Since Independence, Gurdaspur district has had seven Education Ministers. All catered to their respective vote banks,” he added.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); In 2012, then Education Minister Sewa Singh Sekhwan used Rs1 crore from the sports quota to get a stadium constructed near a private school owed by him in his native village. Incumbent Education Minister Aruna Chaudhary added the science and commerce streams in Darbar Pandori Senior Secondary School, but did not allocate adequate staff. It falls in Dinanagar Assembly segment, which she represents. “The ministers upgraded the schools, but did not recruit staff,” Shastri alleged. “Within an 8-km radius of Gurdaspur, there is no staff shortage. But outside, schools operate at just 40 per cent of their strength. No one wants to get posted in the border belt,” he added. Many buildings were constructed just to avail Central funds under the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) — without recruiting/deputing teachers. In Pathankot, there are 150 teachers who share cabs to reach their places of posting in Dera Baba Nanak and Sri Hargobindpur. “As there is no proper transfer policy, teachers spend hours commuting,” said a senior officer. Pathankot DEO Ravinder Kumar said a grant would be used to purchase desks. Other infrastructure will have to wait as the department is short of funds, he added. Amritsar One teacher for 170 students  In a blatant violation of the RTE Act, which stipulates that the pupil-teacher ratio should be 30:1 (primary) and 35:1 (upper primary), it’s as high as 170:1 in Class VIII of Government Senior Secondary School, Balharwal, 40 km from the city. Just 3 km from the international border, this school has nine teachers for 1,145 students. Thirty posts are vacant and there is no science teacher. Burewal village’s Manjit Singh said his two children were studying in the government school at Balharwal village as he couldn’t afford to send them to a private school. Here, 12 teachers are imparting education to 392 students. As many as 377 posts of teachers are lying vacant in the education blocks of Ajnala I, Ajnala-II, Chogawan-I, Chogawan-II and Attari. Government Elementary School, Aliwal village, is a single-room structure with 51 students. A teacher procured plastic chairs to spare toddlers the trouble of sitting on the floor. Government Middle School, Gurala village, has two teachers for 141 students. Many schools have to use wood and cow dung as fuel to provide mid-day meals as one LPG cylinder is insufficient for a month’s cooking. Tarn Taran Primary schools turn day-care centres  Primary schools resemble day-care centres in the absence of teachers. In most primary schools in Khalra, pupils of five classes sit together. There are just two teachers in most schools, one regular and the other hired under the employment guarantee scheme (EGS), alternative innovative education (AIE) and special trainer (STR) programmes. The primary school at Khalra has two regular teachers for 134 students. The building is old and its courtyard gets flooded during the monsoon. The teachers have pooled money to get a water tank installed. At Dodhe village, there is one regular teacher and one ‘STR’ for 80 students. At Amishah village, there are two teachers for 90 students. The border belt has over 100 teachers from Abohar, Fazilka and Mansa who were appointed recently. Many of them admitted they were trying hard to get a posting back home. “The standard of education in the border areas is pitiful. Our children are barely semi-literate,” said Satwant Singh, a retired teacher from Bhikhiwind. DEO Balbir Singh Maini said, “Teacher shortage would end after the process of rationalisation is completed.” Ferozepur Crossing river to reach campus  Malkeet Singh of Kaluwala village a student of Class X, gets up at 3 am every day. After helping his father in early-morning chores, he starts for school at 6 am. It takes two hours to reach the campus at Gatti Rajo Ke village after crossing the Sutlej on a wooden bera (raft), followed by a brisk 4-km walk. His is not an isolated case. There are several teenagers who follow this exhausting routine. Located a few 100 metres from the border, Government Senior Secondary School, Gatti Rajoke, is the only school up to Class XII which caters to almost a dozen villages. “I joined a few months ago and was pained to see the plight of these poor kids. The dropout rate was high and bunking was the norm,” said Satinder Singh, Principal. “I counselled parents who wanted their kids to help them in the fields,” he added. There are 11 teachers against 28 sanctioned posts in the school. Teaching aids are a luxury. So is the availability of drinking water and clean toilets. Paras Khullar, centre head teacher, Government Middle School, Rahime Ke village, rues that there are just four teachers for 160 students. The pupil-teacher ratio is 55:3 at the Jhugge Hajara school, 133:4 at Rajo Ke village, 88:1 at Tindiwala, 159:4 at Gatti Rahime Ke, 50:1 at Bhakhra, 126:4 at Chandiwala, 90:3 at Khunder Gatti and 140:5 at Hussainiwala. Commuting is a problem for the teachers posted here. Many of them have to board and de-board three buses, besides walking a few km to reach the campus. At times, they have to hire cabs and autos. Those who get posted are angling for a transfer, confided a teacher. The schools don’t have funds for the mid-day meal for the past three months. “I don’t know how we will keep feeding the kids,” says Khullar. Malkit Singh, DEO (Secondary), admitted that staff crunch was a perennial problem. Fazilka ‘Upgraded’ schools worst-affected  The upgrade of high schools to senior secondary in August 2016 has largely been only on paper. Shortage of classrooms, benches, potable water and vacancies of lecturers paint a gloomy picture in the border villages of Fazilka district. At Hasta Kalan village, students bring jute bags (taat) from home or just sit on the floor, braving the vagaries of weather. “As many as 200 students are forced to sit in the open,” a teacher said. Five more rooms are required to seat the students. “There is no water to drink as the groundwater is saline,” said Barjinder Singh of Class XI. At Government Senior Secondary School, Jhangar Bhaini village, a stone’s throw from the border, there are five rooms for 725 students. A block of nine rooms has already been declared unsafe. As per official sources, 21 posts of history, 20 of political science, 19 of Punjabi, 10 of economics and six of biology are vacant in 68 senior secondary schools of the district. “The vacancies will be filled and infrastructure strengthened soon,” said DEO Om Parkash Jain.

"Kuljit Bains Responding to Opposition charges of shielding Power and Irrigation Minister Rana Gurjit Singh in the sand mining case, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh has cited the clean chit given to the industrialist-politician by the Justice Narang Commission. It may well be implied that the Chief Minister considers the matter closed, and does not view as important the mass of incriminating prima facie evidence already in public domain but ignored by the commission. (Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd) Capt Amarinder Singh is correct in saying he has followed the due procedure, and is only accepting what has been found by an entirely legitimate exercise. However, he is erring majorly in judging the public perception of the matter. The confidence with which he brazens out the embarrassment will not change people’s view of the allegations. While there is no conclusive evidence yet of the minister’s involvement in any illegality, it is also a fact that an honest effort has not been made to dig out that evidence. It can come only from empowered government investigation agencies — not the media, which has done its job by pointing in a certain direction. Several MLAs within the Congress party are building pressure on the Chief Minister to take action against certain SAD leaders for the alleged wrongs committed under the previous government. These MLAs are essentially responding to a larger public sentiment against matters of corruption. There are subtle hints in this feedback, if anyone wants to pick.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The Chief Minister has repeatedly asserted there will be no politics of vendetta. This is a very valid and healthy decision. But not acting against visible illegalities, past or present, is likely to be seen more as a sign of weakness (if not complicity) than principles. In the daily battle of words over suspected wrongs versus lack of evidence, a crucial factor is missed by the spin masters — the difference between being legally correct and morally correct. A bureaucrat can have the luxury of being only legally and technically correct. However, for a political leader, it is imperative to be seen standing on high moral ground. In fact, many an illegality will be overlooked if his actions are perceived as being in larger public interest. This moral high ground is not visible anywhere in the Punjab government’s denial of wrongs. The list of suspicious activity, leniency, oversight, inaction, or even involvement, on the part of agents or agencies of the government is long. Several businesses, especially the ones dependent on permits or licences, do not even pass the test of legality, forget morality. Mining continued throughout the monsoon despite being prohibited in the season. Several unauthorised sites are being exploited. For one or the other reason, illegitimate bus permits continue. The cable monopoly is yet to be broken, to the detriment of free media. The liquor trade too has become monopolistic, leading to massive smuggling. One sphere where the government may take genuine credit as far as public perception goes is reining in of the drug trade. The unmitigated success the Congress has registered in the Gurdaspur byelection has enabled Capt Amarinder Singh to proclaim the popularity of his government. But it may be sobering to recollect that many governments — UPA-II, SAD-BJP-II in Punjab, even the current NDA at the Centre — saw their quickest slides after the steepest rise. Self-congratulation can have delusionary effects. An important aspect the most powerful and undisputed Congress leader in the state may want to watch out for is this: one minister’s reputation does not affect the repute of a government much; but the day it begins to rub off on the top leader, the consequences can be unhappy.

"Sanjeev Singh Bariana Tribune News Service Chandigarh, August 29 The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has launched an exercise on mapping the causes and remedy for the problems of stench, flies and germs in poultry farms across the state. For this, it has roped in experts from Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (GADVASU), Ludhiana, and those in engineering of poultry farms. The board spurred into action after taking cognisance of complaints from residents, mainly from villages in Barnala, Sangrur, Patiala, Mohali, Ludhiana and Hoshiarpur districts.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Kahan Singh Pannu, PPCB chairman, said the PPCB would compile a report on the basis of feedback from teams of local bodies and panchayats “very shortly”. Jagdev Singh of Bhaini Arora village near Rajpura said: “On numerous occasions, we have seen stray dogs eating dead birds from a poultry farm near our living area. The smell is unbearable. Several villagers, especially children, complain about stomach ailment.” An elderly resident of Ludhiana’s Jhabewal village said “small poultry farmers did not spend on disposal of bird droppings. Bird droppings were a breeding ground for germs. Months of monsoon gave perfect moisture for breeding. The smell, these days, is nauseating”. The state has 594 layer poultry farms (for eggs) and 2,655 small broiler farms (for meat). The layer poultry farms have bird strength between 50,000 and 3 lakh. About 20 farms in this category have more than 5 lakh birds. And broiler farms accommodate between 2,000 and 10,000 birds. Reports have indicated deficiencies in the two farms. Balwant Singh, sarpanch of Mohali’s Salempur Kalan village, said: “Poultry farms in Akalgarh and Tajpura villages have made life hell in nearby eight to nine villages.” Another Salempur Kalan resident Barinder Singh agreed with the sarpanch. “We feel humiliated when visitors don’t eat at our functions,” he said. National Egg Coordination Committee (NECC) vice-chairman Sandeep Mehta, however, claimed there was a problem of sanitation and stench from poultry farms a few years ago. “In the light of changed norms, the poultry industry, particularly layer farms, have upgraded their facilities,” he said. Punjab Broiler Farmers’ Association treasurer Rajkumar Sharma said, “We dispose of birds after every 30 days. A new home is made for the new birds. It is in the case of layer farming, where birds live longer and the public from adjoining areas complain of stench, germs and flies.”"
"Arun Sharma Tribune News Service Ropar, August 29 The district known as a safe haven for sand mining mafia till recently now seems to be proving a gold mine for khair wood mafia. It has been plundering forests in the Paharpur-Samlah area bordering Himachal Pradesh and Nurpur Bedi for the last few months. The district forest officials seem to have turned a blind eye to the menace. Experts say nearly one quintal of red wood is derived after peeling the trunk of a mature khair tree. It fetches nearly Rs10,000 per quintal due to its high demand for medicinal and industrial use.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); On Saturday, a truck carrying 12 tonnes of khair wood worth Rs11 lakh was seized near Ropar. The driver of the truck told the police that he had loaded the wood from Jhinjri village near Kiratpur Sahib and it belonged to one Pramod. Forest officials, however, refused to act in the case claiming that no khair tree was axed from the reserved forest area in the district. A visit to the sub-mountainous areas of Paharpur and Samlah bordering Himachal Pradesh revealed that the axing of khair trees was rampant. While the trees are being axed openly, locals don’t dare to complain against the well-connected people behind the menace. A Paharpur village resident said nearly 300 khair trees were uprooted by an influential person in the village. Though the forest officials kept visiting the area for undertaking plantation in the monsoon, they didn’t bother to stop the illegal activity, he alleged. He claimed that another person on the other side of village had axed more than 400 trees. A forest department worker on the condition of anonymity said the mafia having political patronage was active in Haripur, Kahiwal, Mehendli, Dhanera, Jhinjri, Agampur, Tarapur, Dhadi, Mianpur Handur, Tajpur, Baloli, Dolowal, Ghanor, Nard, Chikna and Jeowal villages of Anandpur Sahib and forests of Nurpur Bedi. Another resident alleged that several craters created due to the uprooting were filled and new saplings planted. On the modus operandi, the sources say the mining mafia obtains NOC from the Forest Department to axe trees in areas not covered under Sections 4 and 5 of the Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900. The department does not bother to inspect the trees grown on such land. Thus, at the time of transporting khair wood, the NOC issued by the department turns a legal permit. Forest Range Officer Gurchet Singh confirmed that they didn’t verify the number of trees, but said the department kept a strict check on illegal felling. AAP leader Dinesh Chadha said the khair mafia was bent upon destroying the ecology of the area. He said they would launch a legal battle, besides a social drive against the mafia."
"New Delhi, August 6  Foodgrain output in the ongoing kharif season is likely to surpass last year’s record of 138.04 million tonnes due to higher acreage and good monsoon for the second straight year, Agriculture Secretary Shobhana K Pattanayak said today. So far, more than 80 per cent of the sowing of kharif crops — paddy, pulses, oilseeds, cotton, sugarcane and jute — has been completed and the planting would continue in some parts till next month, Pattanayak said. About 19 lakh hectare of crop area has been affected by floods across the country and farmers are likely to take up other kharif crops once the water recedes, he said, expressing concern about poor rain in some parts of Karnataka. While there were floods in some states, there was a drought-like situation in parts of Karnataka, Pattanayak said, adding that there had still been close to 3 per cent jump in the acreage under kharif crops so far. Pattanayak said farmers in flood-hit areas would replant other crops in 19 lakh hectare once the water receded.

"Sanjeev Singh Bariana Tribune News Service Chandigarh, July 30 Punjab may have to pay a price in terms of flooding in many areas as a consequence of the unearthing of alleged scams in the government, which diverted the attention of the Irrigation Ministry, and the Assembly elections earlier this year. The distractions pushed to the backburner certain crucial yearly measures required to prevent floods. A meeting of the Flood Control Committee, which is supposed to be held in January, took place only in April because of the Assembly elections, which delayed the steps required for preparedness. The department issued maintenance tenders as late as June 2 for the amount that was sanctioned on May 25. Another indication of the matter having been ignored is that only 140 of the 850 drains in the state have been cleaned, and merely 36 of the 296 vulnerable spots identified along rivers have received approval for strengthening works. Most such spots have been left out as the government sanctioned only Rs 40 crore to the Irrigation Department for flood management. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The comprehensive Flood Preparedness Memorandum-2017 had sought at least Rs 350 crore. Last year, the SAD-BJP government had released Rs 132 crore. Adding to the worries is 5,000 employees of the Irrigation Department who are in mood for agitation over the Vigilance Bureau making inquiries in multiple cases against engineers and officials. Chief Engineer (Irrigation) AK Bansal said, “Our department has spent approximately Rs 30 crore of the sanctioned amount and the ‘danger areas’ have been adequately strengthened. The remaining Rs 10 crore has been kept aside for exigencies during the monsoon.” Fortifying bundhs Harvinder Singh Sohal, SE (Drainage), says the department has spent Rs 5.8 crore on bundh strengthening along 250 km of the Sutlej and Beas. “This amount has been spent in Kapurthala, Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, Ludhiana and Nawanshahr. Machhiwara block and Nawanshahr along the Sutlej and Sultanpur Lodhi along the Beas are the most vulnerable areas this time,” he says. However, Jaswant Singh of Hussainpur Bule village, whose fields are about 4 km from the bundh, says, “There has been no desilting of the riverbed for the past many years. My paddy crop was washed away in 2012.” Jagjit Singh of Sangra village says, “Since our land falls within the Dhussi Bundh, our paddy crop is damaged every year. There is no one to warn or help us.” Paramjit Singh, another farmer from Passan Kadim village, near Baupur Mand, also alleges there has been no desilting. “They just throw sandbags on the grassy banks in the name of bundh strengthening. As a safeguard, we have raised the plinth of our houses by 10-15 feet,” he says. Ghaggar threat The Ghaggar floods Moonak and Khanauri tehsils at regular intervals. In Khanauri, three identified points cause the maximum devastation. Yet, farmers allege, the authorities wake up only when the monsoons are already upon them. The Drainage Department had sent a proposal for Rs 17.36 crore for Patiala, Mohali and Fatehgarh Sahib districts, but only Rs 2 crore was cleared. There are several rivulets and drains in the area, but only the Jacob drain and the Vaddi Nadi have been cleaned. Clogged drains This is one of the districts where no drain has been cleaned for want of funds. Work on one project on the Beas in the Bet area is underway. Why does it flood  Most damage in Punjab due to floods is caused by the Ravi, Sutlej and Ghaggar, which have a common delta where floodwaters meet; and if in spate simultaneously, these rivers can wreak havoc. The silt deposited by the rivers in the delta area raises bed levels, causing overflow. According to the Punjab Disaster Management Action plan, intense rainfall, inadequate drainage, lack of maintenance of flood control and other works (embankments, drainage system, cross drainage works) aggravate the flood situation.  (Inputs by Parvesh Sharma, Harinder Singh Khaira and Deepkamal Kaur)"
"Vibha Sharma Tribune News Service New Delhi, July 21 In its second leg, the southwest monsoon has given a miss to Punjab and adjoining Haryana while the northwest monsoon, that cover Punjab and Haryana, has been 20 per cent deficient. The two states had a fairly good spread of rain in the first weeks of the season in June. Punjab registered a deficiency of 20-59 per cent whereas Chandigarh and Haryana, which along with Delhi form one of the 36 subdivisions, saw a “large deficiency” of 60 per cent or less. DS Pai, Director of IMD’s Pune-based Long Range Forecast, gives two reasons for the rain playing truant. During June-September, the plains normally receive rain when the monsoon current is backed with a western disturbance (WD). As the monsoon progresses from East to West in the northern Himalayan region, following a West to East trend, the WDs help activate the monsoon in the Northwest plains.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Second, though the monsoon trough is active, the axis has shifted south of its position. And it is because of this “shifting” that central parts of India are receiving ‘very good’ rains. Coming back to Punjab and Haryana areas adjoining Rajasthan, Pai says not much rain is expected in the coming few days. “If there is no WD, only scattered rain can be expected till July 25. While July has been rather dry, Punjab and Haryana received 10 and 15 per cent excess rains in June, respectively.” Meanwhile, the IMD says isolated heavy rainfall is expected over the western Himalayan region, particularly Uttarakhand, in the coming two weeks. Technically in the past one week, monsoon further advanced into some more parts of West Rajasthan (on July 14) and further into the remaining parts of Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab, covering the entire country on July 19."

"Arun Sharma Tribune News Service Ropar, July 2 Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) officials are upbeat over the fast increase in the water level at Bhakra and Pong dams this year. The water level in the Gobind Sagar reservoir of Bhakra Dam increased to 1569.32 feet today, against 1523.56 feet, the lowest level recorded during the last one year on March 31. Similarly, the water level at Pong Dam was recorded today at 1298.63 feet against 1286.94 on June 20, the lowest level during the last one year. BBMB member, Irrigation, SK Sharma said due to the substantial snowfall during the winter season, the inflow in both dams was good since the onset of summer. Further, with good rains in the region, now the demand of water from Rajasthan and Haryana has dwindled. Because of that, the outflow from dams was far less when compared to last year. Keeping in view the forecast of a good monsoon season, both dams were likely to be filled up to the brim before the filling period ends on September 20, he said.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The filling period of the Bhakra and Pong reservoirs starts from May 21 and June 21, respectively. While the water storage capacity of the Bhakra Dam is up to 1,680 feet, at Pong Dam, the water is stored up to 1,390 feet. Last year, the scanty rains had reduced the water level at Bhakra Dam to 1,650.38 feet on September 21, 2016, the last day of the filling period. This was the lowest water level in the reservoir this decade. Earlier in this decade, at the end of the filling season, the lowest level was recorded at 1,655.83 feet on September 21, 2011. On September 21, the water level at the Pong Dam was recorded at 1,369.31 feet against 1,380.95 feet recorded the previous year. The situation this year seems to be different as today’s inflow at Bhakra Dam was recorded at 34,802 cusecs against 35,627 cusecs last year.

"Tribune News Service Muktsar, June 18   Archit Watts  The monsoon season is about to begin but there is hardly any check on the illegal excavation of soil from along the Chandbhan drain, which has reportedly weakened its banks and decreased the water carrying capacity.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });  Notably, this is the highest-capacity carrier drain in this region and takes water of all other drains. It has a capacity of 13,000 cusecs and falls in the Sutlej river in Fazilka district. It passes from Faridkot, Muktsar and Fazilka districts.  A visit along the Chandbhan drain from Rupana to Rahoorianwali village here revealed that at a number of places, its banks had gone lower than the level of bridges. Further, some cracks have appeared at a number of places on the banks.   Some villagers living nearby said the illegal soil excavation was a regular practice, mostly during the night hours but no action was ever taken.  Mukhtiar Singh Rana, Executive Engineer, Canal Lining Division, Drainage Department, Ferozepur, said, “We have lodged some complaints with the police in this regard. Some persons have even been caught red-handed with heavy machines while excavating soil illegally. Further, Forest Department officials too have initiated action against some people for digging soil. Now, we will start a drive to keep a check on this illegal practice.”  Meanwhile, sources said some department officials too were involved in this illegal activity, aiding those digging soil. “The farmers dig the soil and sell it at a high price. The practice is going on since long, but the department officials are sitting as mute spectators,” they claimed.  Notably, in 2013, when the rains had inundated a large number of fields, this drain had proved much helpful in draining the water. "
"Jupinderjit Singh Tribune News Service Chandigarh, June 11 Even as the government is struggling to ensure a clean and transparent mining business, people await sand at affordable prices. A reality check by The Tribune reporters found that prices have instead gone up substantially. The controversy pertaining to Congress Minister Rana Gurjit Singh’s alleged involvement in the auction of mines through his former employees and the cancellation of 56 mines have worsened the situation. With only about 90 mines operational so far, the prices are expected to soar further in the ongoing construction season. Otherwise also, the prices were to go high as the quarries were auctioned at much higher prices this year. The price of sand has increased from Rs 14,000 per 800 cubic ft to Rs 19,000 per 800 cubic ft in just two months.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Inquiries by The Tribune found that sand was now available between Rs 15,000 and Rs 25,000 per tipper (900 cubic ft) in different parts of the state depending on the sand quality and distance from the mine. Simarjit Bains, Lok Insaaf Party MLA, who had opened a morcha against high sand prices last year, said the consumers were paying through the nose. “When we took on illegal mining in mid-2016, the prices were up to Rs 35,000 per tipper. Later, these came down to around Rs 10,000. Now, it’s reversal again. Against every legal vehicle transporting sand at least five illegal are plying.” Tippers are used by large construction houses or distributors. But for the common man, the rates of sand per tractor-trailer are more relevant. The prevailing rates are Rs 2,000 to Rs 5,000 per tractor-trailer having a capacity of 125 to 200 cubic ft. The prices have gone up by more than 20-30 per cent and even doubled at various places. In Patiala, good quality sand starts from Rs 3,000 per tractor-trailer. In Ludhiana, the prices are Rs 3,000-Rs 4,000 depending on the quality and size of the vehicle. In Moga, the prices have increased by 15-20 per cent in two months. Rajat Bansal, a local businessman, said he bought a small tractor-trailer of sand for Rs 1,800. It had cost Rs 1,400 to Rs 1,500 a few months ago. Jaswinder Singh, another Moga resident, said he bought a small truck of sand for Rs 7,000. Its price was Rs 5,500 a few months ago. Amit Kumar, a Muktsar resident, said: “The prices were stable at around Rs 1,500-Rs 2,000 for a year or so, but now these have almost doubled. We were expecting the prices to come down, but it’s exactly the opposite.” Gursharan Singh, general manager, District Industries Centre, Muktsar, said: “There is no mining of sand and gravel in Muktsar district. We thus don’t have any control on the prices.” In Pathankot, locals claim that an average capacity truck was available for Rs 4,500 till last year, but the rates have almost doubled now. “Till two years ago, if somebody wanted to construct a 250 sq yd two-storied house in Patiala and ordered sand and gravel from Pathankot, it cost him just Rs 1.5 lakh for three tippers of gravel and four of sand (including transportation cost). Now, the same will cost him anything between Rs 2.8 lakh and Rs 3 lakh,” claimed a real estate developer. Meanwhile, a spokesperson of the state Mining Department said the prices were high due to high demand and relatively lower availability of sand. The demand was for 2 crore tonnes of sand annually but the availability is just about 1 crore tonne. “The prices are market driven. The government cannot control it. An ideal situation will be that against the demand for 2 crore tonnes, the availability is 3 crore tonnes. The government has taken several measures, but it will take some time. Presently, the demand is at its peak. Mining won’t take place for three months during the monsoon. We are looking at October-November period for maximum mining.” (With inputs from Archit Watts, Kulwinder Sandhu and Ravi Dhaliwal)"

The weather department has already given the forecast of timely arrival of normal monsoon in the last week of June in the region. Agro-scientist Dr Jaswinder Singh Brar posted in the cotton belt of Punjab in Mansa district said, “Nowadays, the sowing of maize is better than the late sowing of cotton because the insects, pests and diseases attack the late-sown cotton crop more, causing huge losses to the farmers.” (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });If there is any scarcity of canal water, farmers may not be able to sow cotton.

It also helps control weeds. The latest studies conducted by agriculture universities and the state Agriculture Department indicate that optimum row spacing should be 60 cm with a plant population of 80,000 per hectare to get maximum yield of maize crop. “Maize can be grown in the kharif season during June, which is the best time to get good yield,” he said.

The youths claimed that they see mining taking place daily with heavy machines. Dharamkot sub-division in Moga district is one of the places in the state where sand mining has been taking place for years. More than 50 per cent of the sand requirement of the Malwa belt is met from sand extracted from the Sutlej. Most of the trucks engaged in sand mining operations do not have government permits. The mining mafia is also causing huge damage to the ecology, water resources, agriculture and the livelihood of people. It has reduced the forest area along the river belt. The riverbed has also gone down by 5-8m at many places over the years. As Sutlej sand is of high quality, indiscriminate mining has been going on for the past many years. The villagers allege that the district administration is aware of the illegal mining but has deliberately turned a blind eye. “We grow crops near the river that have been destroyed many times by trucks ferrying sand from the river. We have complained to the local authorities numerous times but to no avail.

"Vijay Mohan and Sanjeev Singh Bariana Tribune News Service Chandigarh, March 31 While the water level in the Gobind Sagar reservoir at Bhakra Dam is down to just about 14 per cent of its storage capacity, good snowfall over the Himalayas this winter is expected to offset the water deficiency.

Power cannot be generated if water level falls below 1,462 feet. “The average inflow at present is 8,800 cusecs as compared to 6,750 cusecs last year,” an official said. “Over the last two years, we were monitoring inflows as per ‘dry’ pattern, the lowest of three categories. Now it is between the ‘dependable’ and ‘mean’ categories, which places us in a fairly comfortable position,” he said. Higher temperatures during spring season could be taken as an indication of a good monsoon, though the Meteorological Department was yet to issue its long-term forecast, BBMB officials said. Earlier this week, a private weather forecast agency had predicted that the monsoon could be less than normal. The level at Pong Dam is 17 per cent of its capacity, as compared to last 10 year’s average of 28 per cent.

"Sanjiv Kumar Bakshi  Hoshiarpur, March 5 Spread over 14 or 15 km in the hilly terrain of Kandi area, Kookanet village still has no road connectivity. In the absence of a road, a khadd (shallow water channel) serves as the lifeline for villagers. Though bus service is there, it picks and drops people at a point far away from the village and people are forced to cover the rest of the distance on foot, wading through the khadd that remains submerged throughout the year. Gurbachan Singh, president of the Village Welfare Society, says, “A private mini bus operates in the area, covering Hariana town and lower parts of Kookanet area. After Residents of upper areas have to deboard the bus and walk for several kilometres. They, at times, get complimentary rides on tractor-trolleys, but in case they don’t, there’s is no way other than traversing the water channel. Students face it everyday. During rainy days, the lone government school in the area becomes inaccessible. Monsoon makes us confined to our houses for days, giving a feeling as if we are residing on an island, waiting for the water level to lower down in khadd.” According to Gurbachan, people have been demanding a pucca road for years, but to no avail. “During elections, leaders hesitate to pay a visit to us. If they do, we raise this issue and they reply every time that it will be done on a priority basis, but nothing has been done so far,” he adds. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });Satpal, village Sarpanch, says people are facing the problem and efforts are being made to solve the issue. “It will take time. We have made a path of around 900 metres. We are trying to extend it further to improve connectivity.

"Aman Sood Tribune News Service Patiala, February 22 “Ithay ton kisse ne nahi aauna. Tusi patarkaar vi kabrao na (Nobody will come from this side. Journalists should not worry),” said Haryana’s Harjit Singh, who owns land in Ismailpur village. He claimed that no political outfit could dig the Sutlej-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal. Ismailpur is the first village in Haryana’s Ambala district and borders Kapoori village in Patiala district. Water flows in the canal near the Haryana border with Irrigation Department officials claiming that part of the canal in Punjab gets water from Bhakhra, but it is too less to flow to Ambala.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The SYL canal at almost the entire stretch near Kapoori passes along the Bhakhra Main Line, which is full of water. Roads and two bridges in Ismailpur had no police presence in spite of an alert, and there was no restriction on the entry of vehicles as a team of The Tribune visited the site today afternoon. The police, however, have put up a naka 2 km inside Punjab. A group of five elderly farmers sitting on the outskirts of Kapoori said that the INLD and for that matter any other party could not dig the canal. They pointed to water in the canal to prove their point. “Whatever little water flows in it is because of monsoon and nearby Bhakhra channel. Can you believe that anyone can dig it with tools or machinery? The announcement to dig the canal is just to hog the limelight,” one of them said. Others nodded. Two of them — Sarbjit Singh and Ram Kishan — were from Haryana, while the rest were from Punjab. They were worried that calls for a march over riverwaters had disturbed camaraderie among people, who were one once. “The dispute is among two states, and not two countries. There has to be a solution. Communities cannot be divided over a matter that does not suit one political party,” a farmer said. Villagers in Kapoori, where the foundation stone of the canal was laid, said the canal had turned fellow villagers, who were once neighbours, into enemies. For this, they blamed political leadership of the two states. “The INLD’s announcement is a political stunt. As the party is fighting for its survival, it dawned upon its leadership to safeguard Haryana’s interests,” Kapoori resident Baldev Singh said. “In Punjab, the ruling SAD-BJP alliance and the Congress did nothing for years. Now, they are issuing statements that they won’t allow water to flow out of Punjab.” Some villagers said political outfits were raking up the matter to settle scores. “It is like playing a political football for vested interests,” said Gurjant Singh, who got back 3 acres acquired for the canal. “The Punjab Government tells the Supreme Court that land was returned to actual owners and it was difficult to re-acquire the land. It’s a disputed land and owners do not know whether or not they own it. Further, the land has been dug deep. At some places, the depth is more than 20 ft. I do not have resources to fill the land and start irrigation,” he said."
"Arun Sharma Tribune News Service Bela Ajouli (Nangal), Feb 12 Four days after a wooden bridge on the Sutlej connecting nearly two dozen villages with Nangal town collapsed, dejected residents of the area have started collecting money for its repair. They said neither any government agency nor public representative, including the local MLA, came forward to help them. While present MLA and Industry Minister Madan Mohan Mittal did not even bother to visit the spot, former Congress MLA and party nominee Rana KP Singh during his visit to the village today did nothing except assuring the villagers to provide better connectivity in case his party formed the government after March 11. Ironically, Shiv Sena candidate Nitin Nanda has contributed Rs21,000 for the bridge repair. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });As the bridge has been damaged badly, they will require at least Rs5 lakh for its repair, say villagers. On February 8, the wooden bridge built by village residents 16 years ago in 2001 for Rs5 lakh fell down, resulting in injuries to nine people. In the absence of the bridge, the residents of 20 villages, including Bela Ajouli, Bela Dhiani, Mjara, Bela Dargahi, Bela Bahatian, Passiwal, Palasi, Gohlian and Bhalan, have to cover around 20-km distance to reach the nearest town of Nangal. Ravi Kumar of Ajouli village said before the construction of this bridge, all villages on the other side used to be cut off from the main land and to shift a patient or grains from their fields to Nangal, camels were used. Even after constructing the bridge, the residents had to use boats during monsoon as the water level in the river inundated the approaches of the bridge, he added. Kamal Singh of Bela Dhiani village said though all parties promised them a bridge every time during elections, nothing had been done till now. Mittal visited the area only once after elections in 2012, he said, adding that the next time he visited was a few months before the elections this time. While no health services are available in these villages, a middle school was set up at Bela Ajouli in the name of education facilities. In the absence of the bridge, the students either have to miss their schools or college or cover a distance of 29 km to reach their institution, says Mangal Singh of Bela Dhiani. “The local administration now has provided a few pipes to lay a temporary path to cross the river. This arrangement will last merely a few weeks as the rising water level in the river will wash it down,” he added. While Mittal did not take calls, Rana KP Singh said it was apathy on part of the SAD-BJP government who did not provide any bridge in this part of the state during their 10-year regime.  "

This is absolutely misleading because right in the neighbouring J&K areas, the villages adjoining the border have pucca bridges.” Certain common problems of the people in these areas are inaccessibility for pregnant women in emergency and teachers and students facing difficulty in reaching schools, besides several others."
"Sanjeev Singh Bariana Tribune News Service Kasauli (Kharar), February 4 About 1,500 voters from four villages of Majri block, located less than 15 km from Chandigarh, exercised their franchise today, even as they registered a protest against lack of education for their children after Class X, poor roads and no bridges. These villages had decided last month to boycott the polls. On behalf of the panchayats of Bagindi, Karaundewala, Kasauli and Gudapind villages, Kasauli sarpanch Bhim Sain tried to hand over a memorandum to Booth-Level Officer Palwinder Singh in Government Primary School.

"Deepkamal Kaur Tribune News Service Jalandhar, January 21 Who said campaigning was easy? When one segment has a river passing through it and another, non-motorable roads and hillocks, canvassing becomes a test of stamina and endurance. Ask AAP candidates Sajjan Singh Cheema (Sultanpur Lodhi) and Dr Ravjot Singh (Sham Chaurasi). Cheema often takes a boat to cross the Beas and reach Mand area, while Dr Singh climbs up and down hilly tracks in Dholbaha to reach out to the electorate. Arjuna awardee basketball player, Cheema has been campaigning for almost seven months. “I visited my house in Jalandhar a few times ever since I started canvassing. I am putting up in Sultanpur Lodhi so that it is easy for me to commute. Otherwise, it is impossible to follow the tough routine that an AAP candidate is expected of,” he says.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The former Superintendent of Police (SP) campaigned when summers and monsoon were at their peak. And now in these chilly conditions, there’s been no let up in his campaign. “The pontoon bridge on the Beas which is a link to Mand area is lifted during the monsoons. So, I crossed the river on a boat even when it was swollen.” The result of his long campaign has been five visits to easily accessible areas of Sultanpur Lodhi. “But I could cover Baupur and other villages that form islands in Beas only twice,” says Cheema, who took a boat to Mehmoodpur village today to meet about 200 people again. As for Dr Singh, who owns a hospital in Hoshiarpur, he traverses a tough terrain to reach out to every house in his segment. The kandi area in the Sham Chaurasi segment has villages on hillocks that are inaccessible by road. “In a day, I usually cover six to seven villages in plains, while only half a village is covered in kandi area where houses are 500 metres apart. As there is a risk of wild animals in the area, my supporters and I wind up the campaign by 5 pm,” he says. Any laxity in canvassing, given the tough terrain candidates traverse? To ensure there’s no slackness, party observers have been sent from Delhi to monitor campaigning. Observers ensure that every household is covered."
"Vijay Mohan Tribune News Service Chandigarh, January 2 With winter rain and snow in the region being severely deficient, water storage in the crucial Gobind Sagar reservoir at Bhakra Dam has fallen to just 45 per cent of its total capacity. This has prompted the Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) to impose a 10 per cent cut in water supply to its member states. The water level at Bhakra stood at 1,601.36 feet today, down 79 feet from its maximum permissible level of 1,680 feet and about 45 feet from last year’s corresponding level. Given the prevailing climatic conditions and demand from the states, BBMB officials have forecast a further drop of 20-25 feet per month till the filling season starts in May. (Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); “We are required to maintain a minimum level of 1,507 feet and though it is not a crisis as yet, the situation warrants exercise of due prudence and caution,” a BBMB official said. BBMB releases water to Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan in accordance with their stipulated share.  There have been instances where storage level at Bhakra has dropped below 45 per cent. In 1985, the water had dropped to 1,463 feet, just a foot above its dead storage level, implying that the reservoir was virtually devoid of usable water. Cuts in water supply, BBMB officials said, have socio-economic as well as law and order ramifications. Data released by the Central Water Commission (CWC), which monitors reservoir levels across the country, reveals that the storage level at Bhakra was 70 per cent at this time last year. At Pong on the Beas in Himachal, the storage level at present is also 45 per cent as compared to 54 per cent last year. The storage at Thein Dam on the Ravi in Punjab is 37 per cent, which is better than last year’s 25 per cent, but below the 10-year average of 45 per cent. The India Meteorological Department data reveals that post-monsoon rainfall has been deficient by 93 per cent in Himachal Pradesh, 91 per cent in Punjab and by 78 per cent in Haryana since October 1, while in Jammu and Kashmir it is deficient by 92 per cent. “Though there was some rain and snow in the region over the past few days, it did not have any impact on storage,” a source said. Weather forecasts say January would receive more rains. However, if the water level depletes naturally, it will enable the much-needed low level inspection of Bhakra Dam without BBMB having to deliberately drain out the reservoir."
"Aparna Banerji With 70 per cent Dalit population, the Phillaur reserved constituency is the key to Doaba. Political parties are working on caste calculations to find a winning formula. The SAD, who won the seat in the previous two elections, has placed its bet, not on sitting MLA Avinash Chander, but on a new face — Baldev Khaira — who joined the SAD after quitting the BSP earlier this year. Chander didn’t get the ticket as his name cropped up in the Jagdish Bhola drug racket. Ignored, he left the SAD. In 2012, Chander had scraped past Chaudhary Santokh Singh (now the Jalandhar MP) of the Congress, winning by only 31 votes. In the 2007 elections, Santokh had lost to the SAD’s Sarwan Singh Phillaur by 273 votes. As Phillaur, too, was stained by the drug taint, the SAD didn’t nominate him. He switched over to the Congress. Phillaur is eyeing the party ticket, along with Santokh’s son Vikramjit Chaudhary. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has fielded Saroop Singh Kadiana, a member of a Dhadi jatha. He is from the Ravidassia community. From the BSP, its former state president Avtar Singh Karimpuri will contest. Whoever wins, he will have his task cut out as there is a crying need for basic amenities in villages. A majority of the villages doesn’t have sewerage connections and garbage disposal sites.

"Aparna Banerji Located amid lush-green fields, the Jamsher dairy complex looks incongruous, a desolate wasteland in the back of beyond. Bad roads, pools of stagnant water and alleys inundated with sewage – the promise of making it a “state of the art” locality has sunk without a trace. The complex is among the three ills that plague the rural areas of Jalandhar Cantonment constituency, the others being the proposed solid waste treatment plant (STP) at Jamsher village and the water treatment plant at Pholariwal. The “people-unfriendly” threesome has triggered a series of protests by the villagers against the state government. Satpal, a 60-year-old Nanak Pindi resident, says agitatedly, “Our villages have turned into a dump. Should we live in this hell or simply die?” With a jump, he crosses a concrete fence dividing the street from the flooded alley and stands knee-deep in a stinking pool of sludge. “This dung-heavy water is not only spreading diseases but also eating into the foundations of our houses.” He tells us that the villagers have lost count of the politicians and officials they’ve met over the issue. “Pargat Singh (sitting MLA) came here a few years ago. Sarabjit Makkar (Akali candidate) visited recently. They all know about our problems, but have failed to come up with any solution,” he says. His neighbour, Inderjit Singh, who owns a dairy, wants to be heard too. He shouts, “The mosquitoes don’t spare us even in the winter. Our skin is covered with rashes and boils.” The flooded street has snapped their access to each other. In the monsoon, say residents, the water enters their houses as well. The villagers claim that their metal utensils, wire meshes and taps rust within months due to the toxins from the two “ganda nullahs” flowing near the complex, which has over 300 dairies.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Shifted to the complex over a decade ago, the dairy owners are a disillusioned lot. They call themselves the government’s forgotten vote bank, conveniently pushed out of the city with promises of development that were never fulfilled. Anil Chander, an entrepreneur, says, “We are residents of urban areas who have set up dairies here. Initially, some roads were built, but the kutcha ones are clogged with sewage. Some of us also built houses here, only to realise later that it’s just not feasible to live in such surroundings.” The proposed STP has added fuel to the fire. The hot-button issue became the prime reason for Pargat’s exit from the SAD as he took up the cudgels on behalf of the villagers. Kanwaljit Kaur, sarpanch of Chitebani village, had threatened to immolate herself last year if the government went ahead with the project. She refuses to budge from her stand: “We won’t allow any politician to enter our village unless they give a written undertaking that the STP will be scrapped. Stray animals plunder our crops, the dairy waste chokes our streets and now they want to dump garbage here. We will die before letting that happen. We are backing Pargat because he took on the government for our sake.” To make matters worse, drugs have made inroads into the area in the past few years. Former Jamsher sarpanch Harinder Singh Bittu Shah says, “In the past year, at least seven villagers have succumbed to drugs. And that bad disease (AIDS) has also reared its ugly head. Seven years ago, the Sadar police station from the city was shifted here. Ironically, the drug menace has tightened its grip since then. We don’t know what the cops are doing.” The voters of the constituency’s urban area have a different set of problems. Their long-pending demands: abolition of ‘undue’ octroi, access to a peripheral road and mobile connectivity. The cantonments of Jalandhar and Ferozepur are the only ones in the state where octroi is still being levied. “We’ll get it abolished” — several politicians have used this line to woo voters ahead of one election after the other. The promise was made by SAD candidates Jagbir Brar and Pargat Singh in the 2007 and 2012 Assembly poll, respectively. Both won; it was the voters who lost faith. As per information obtained under the RTI Act, octroi to the tune of over Rs61 crore has been collected from residents over the past decade. Harvinder Setia, a trader, says, “Octroi was abolished across 133 MCs as per the state government’s 2006 gazette notification, which instead levied 10 per cent surcharge on VAT. In a 2008 notification, Jalandhar and Ferozepur Cantonment Boards were also exempted from paying it. However, dual charges are being imposed on us illegally.” The boundary walls erected by the Army near Dhina village and on a stretch at Hallotali village have restricted the movement of commuters between the urban and rural areas. The structures have also blocked the link roads meant for inter-village connectivity. Locals have been fighting for access to the phirni road for the past many years, with over 100 RTI applications being filed. For the time being, they have no option but to make a detour of 6 km or more to reach their destination. Ram Sehdev, a local entrepreneur, says, “We have been let down by all parties. Pargat did make efforts regarding the peripheral road, but he drew a blank over his 16-point manifesto. We have even approached the Centre in vain. It all boils down to political will, which is lacking.” In the age of smartphones, cantonment residents are heavily dependent on the landline. Reason: This is a high-security area where private mobile phone towers are a no-no. Still stuck in the 20th century? Yes, many of them do feel that way at times."
"Arun Sharma No bumps, no potholes, no hassle. It’s a smooth ride on the roads of this Assembly constituency, represented by Akali MLA and Education Minister Daljit Singh Cheema. A confidant of Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, the doctor-turned-politician had been picked instead of sitting SAD legislator Sant Ajit Singh in the 2012 Assembly election. Now, he’s leaving no stone unturned to woo the hard-to-please voters. This sadaknama is enviably long: The widening of the 32-km Ropar-Nurpur Bedi road up to Jhajj Chowk is in full swing, while the 10-km Nurpur Bedi-Bunga Sahib road has already been recarpeted. Work on two roads — the 15-km Brahmand and Bhuriwale Marg and 33-km Brahm Sagar Bhuriwale Marg — is nearing completion. A bypass has helped in decongesting the town to a great extent. Cheema’s efforts, however, don’t seem to be good enough for the locals, who still have a long list of unresolved issues, including potable water scarcity, unemployment and corruption. Many feel that the last-minute flurry of development works is a political compulsion for the ruling party due to the fast-approaching elections. “The town residents have been seeking an upgrade of the bus stand for years. All that successive MLAs have given us is promises,” says Rajinder Singh Saini, a retired government employee. The demand for the expansion of the railway station has also been pending for long, he adds. People of this area are largely dependent on agriculture and have small land holdings. A thermal plant and a cement factory were set up three decades ago. “Both have only partially met the demand for providing employment to the local youth. And the air pollution caused by these two plants is a major cause for concern,” says Sunil Kumar, standing at the Ghanauli bus stop.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The residents of Purkhali and surrounding villages — known as the Ghad area — are more vocal in blaming the state government for their plight. “During the monsoon, we remain cut off from Chandigarh and other areas as the MLA couldn’t get a bridge built on a choe on the Bindrakh road,” says Dr SS Mand, a retired Army officer. He adds that the area needs a road to connect it with the neighbouring industrial town of Baddi in Himachal Pradesh, where employment avenues can be explored, but the state government isn’t bothered about the project. Ranjit Singh, a government bus driver, won’t vote for the ruling party this time. Reason: “I have been working on a contract basis for years, drawing a meagre salary of Rs 8,000.” Lack of gainful employment rankles. Baljeet Singh, a farmer, tells us that the educated youths have no choice but to take up menial jobs. Malkit Singh, a postgraduate, works as a tipper driver with a stone crusher, while Daljit Singh, who has a degree in civil engineering, is looking after the cattle at home. Bindrakh village resident Gurjit (18), who works at a nearby stone crusher, is excited about voting for the first time. He openly states his choice: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Any specific reason? “Tussi jaande ho ajj kal saare udhar nu hi jaa rahe ne. Kal bhi Sandoye di Ghanauli wali meeting wich saade ilake ton bahut saare loki pahuche si. Apne aap (People are generally inclined towards AAP these days. Many residents of our area voluntarily attended a party meet yesterday),” he says, referring to party candidate Amarjit Singh Sandoya. The silver lining for the SAD is its committed vote bank. Manpreet (26), a graduate from nearby Barri village, says unprecedented development has been witnessed across the state during the Akali-BJP rule. He, however, feels that the alliance faces an uphill task due to the poor image of some of its leaders. “Many of them have plundered sand quarries. Everybody knows that the ruling family has business interests in almost every big industry in the state,” he observes frankly. “Most of my family members are die-hard SAD supporters, but my elder brother wants to vote for AAP,” Manpreet adds. At Chak Karma village on the Purkhali-Ghanauli road, residents complain that they have been deprived of drinking water supply for the past year. “A tubewell installed for the purpose is out of order and people have to go to the fields to draw water from tubewells,” says Bir Pal, a cook. The battlelines are clearly drawn at Chanoli village on the Bunga Sahib-Nurpur Bedi road. Here, there are supporters of the Congress, the SAD and AAP. Though residents agree that Cheema has liberally provided funds for development, they are divided over his intentions. Congress and AAP camps dub it as a last-ditch attempt to woo voters, while the SAD group sees Cheema as a pro-active MLA who has transformed the area beyond recognition. A bunch of villagers sitting at a sweet shop is bitterly criticising the SAD. But none of them is willing to identify himself. They say in one voice that corruption has spread its tentacles during the Akali-BJP rule. One of them claims that most of the development works, including roads and a bridge, were initiated by the Congress government a decade ago; the ruling alliance woke up only recently to maintain the same.  A septuagenarian standing at a distance informs us that five of these critics are Congress and AAP supporters, while another is his brother and a SAD worker from adjoining Sheikhpur village. Going ahead, we reach Nurpur Bedi, known as a Congress stronghold. The widening and strengthening of the main road are progressing fast.  Gurinder Singh, a resident of Singh village, feels that focusing on roads alone can’t bring about development. “Where are the job opportunities?” he asks. “Not even a single job was created in the whole district during the past 10 years.”  Satinder Singh, a veterinarian, echoes Gurinder’s opinion. He admits that the Congress’ successive defeats (2007 and 2012) have affected the area residents, even though some development has taken place in recent months. Work started on a Rs 26-crore project in 2013 to provide potable water. “It was to be completed within two years, but people are still drinking water unfit for human consumption,” says Satinder. Still, something’s always better than nothing, he adds as an afterthought.

It becomes worst when mosquitoes start hovering around stagnant water,” the sarpanch said. Lambardar Randhir Singh claimed houses had come up on a large section of a dried-up canal. “Potholed roads are another eyesore. Only a street has been laid in concrete and the only project near completion is a 66-KV power station,” he said. Pardeep Singh, a village resident, said the village school did not have science and commerce streams. The supply of drugs is another cause for worry for the villagers. Tractor operator Ganesh Ram claimed, “I have often seen well-built lads in SUVs, providing youths with drugs in the periphery of the village.” Sampla said, “The scheme does not provide for any special grant. It is an effort to involve the people in doing works and set an example (adarsh) for others. The demands of villagers are in my knowledge.

Travel for a while and you will get used to it.” This road is linked to the Jalalabad road, which is under construction. Several manholes are left uncovered, posing a grave risk to the motorists. As we stop outside a fuel station to wipe the dust off the face and click pictures of the road, a middle-aged man, Sant Parkash Singh, stops his motorcycle. Then he gets going: “Press wale ho? Saare shahar da hi bura haal ae. Kinniya ku photoan khichonge? Naa paani dhang da hai, naa sadkaan, naa hi sewerage system. Ehi sadak dekh lo, kinni der ton eddan di hi hai. Kamm kuch din chalda hai, fer rukk janda hai. Hai te eh eh zila, par haal pind nalo vi maada hai (Are you journalists? The entire town is in bad shape. How many photos will you click? Work on this road is being done in fits and starts. This is the district headquarters, but its condition is poorer than that of the villages).” Asked about the ongoing development works, he replies, “Eh taan lok votan velle dassange vikas ki hunda ae. Khaas karke oh lok jihna nu es sarkar de hundeya thaane da koi kamm pya hou. Kuch der pehla ek Dalit munda vadh ke maar ditta par parivaar waleya nu insaaf layi dharna launa pya (The public will give their verdict on development during the elections. Especially those people who had to visit a police station for their work. Recently, a Dalit youth was hacked to death and the family had to lodge a protest to seek justice).” Going ahead, we see a group of elderly men playing cards on the roadside. Eager to talk about poll issues, one of them says, “Many people from far-flung areas come to our town to pay obeisance at the historic gurdwara, but see the condition of the road leading to its entrance number 7. Waterlogging has made people’s lives miserable.” After passing through narrow lanes of the old town, we reach the entrance in question, where there is hardly any space for commuters as a sewerage system is being installed. After a brief introduction, Shamsher Singh and Kulwant Singh, both in their mid-sixties, narrate their plight. “For the past 10 years, our street has been bearing the brunt of rainwater and sewage. All our pleas fell on deaf ears. Thankfully, the elections are approaching and someone thought of starting work,” they say. Naseeb Kaur claims that the construction work is not only belated but also faulty. “It will create new problems for us,” she says.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Travelling on the bank road and the railway road, we see some high-mast light poles and streets paved with interlocked tiles — a semblance of the development trumpeted by SAD leaders such as Akali halqa incharge Kanwarjit Singh ‘Rozy Barkandi’. Ankush Deep, a geologist, put things in perspective: “Galiyan te Rozy Barkandi de kehan te ban gaiyan. Par shahar da sewerage system kharaab hai te dekhna eh hai ke kinni ku der theek rehndiya ne (The streets have been constructed with the efforts of Rozy Barkandi. But the city’s sewerage system is defective and it remains to be seen how long these will last).” After a whirlwind tour of the town, we travel a few km on the Kotkapura road, where a toll plaza is coming at Warring village. It is being opposed by local residents. “The road has been widened, but the new bridges on the twin canals are yet to be built. Luckily, the toll plaza has not yet become functional,” say villagers standing at the bus stop. At Udekaran village, Gurtej Singh says, “Development has taken place in proportion to the votes that went into the Akali kitty. Our village voted for the Akali candidate during the Block Samiti elections, yet only a few streets are being built because earlier the Congress always got more votes from here.” He recalls that the CM came to their village during the monsoon in 2013, when it was waterlogged, but no drainage system has been put in place till date. “Let’s see what the Congress or AAP will do if they come to power. During her tenure, Bibi ji (sitting MLA Karan Kaur Brar) could not do anything, maybe because the Congress was in the Opposition,” Gurtej adds. The gates built at all entrances to the town in memory of the 40 mukte (liberated ones) — the Sikhs who attained martyrdom during Guru Gobind Singh’s last battle against the Mughals here in 1705 — are also a picture of neglect, with some pieces of red marble missing. Travelling through the serpentine bypass road, we again reach the local bus stand, where Gurjeet Singh, a bus conductor, says, “Governments have come and gone, but nobody has stopped the overloaded tractor-trailers plying on the Malout road, which also needs to be widened. Sewage continues to spill over on to the Jalalabad road near Fattanwala village. The town residents are still lucky as some beautification is done ahead of the annual Maghi Mela in January.” Social activist Sham Lal Goyal, who is leading a campaign for the construction of the town’s maiden railway overbridge, says Deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal had laid the foundation stone in February 2014, before the parliamentary elections, but the tenders have been floated only now. Then comes his parting shot: “The Tribune has written a lot about waterlogging, but the government has failed to come up with any long-term solution.” Last election result Winner  Karan Kaur Brar (Congress) Votes polled 55,108 Runner-up Kanwarjit ‘Rozy Barkandi’ (SAD) Votes polled 45,853"
"Arun Sharma A ride on the 15-km road, smooth and wide, from Ropar to Chamkaur Sahib gives the impression that all is well with this haloed land of Sikh martyrs. The illusion is shattered as you go inside the constituency, represented by Congress Legislature Party chief and Leader of the Opposition Charanjit Singh Channi since 2007. You first have to shell out Rs 62 at the toll plaza for the journey between the district headquarters and this town; a bumpy ride is in store if you decide to go towards Morinda, the only other town of the Assembly seat. It takes at least 45 minutes to cover 15 km on the potholed, dusty road between Chamkaur Sahib and Morinda. Under fire from residents over the poor condition of roads, ex-minister and SAD halqa incharge Satwant Kaur Sandhu had staged a protest against her own party’s government recently. Even that didn’t alter the state of affairs. There is anguish among the voters over the lack of development during the past about 10 years. Ironically, people stop short of blaming the local MLA for the mess. Instead, they don’t mince words while terming the state government, particularly the Shiromani Akali Dal, responsible for their plight. “No industrial unit has been established in the area to provide employment to the local youths,” says Roshan Lal, a shopkeeper. The only one, Agni Bio Energy, set up at nearby Kandhola village four years ago to manufacture fuel pellets using paddy stubble, was shut down in 2014. Ram Singh, a farmer sitting beside Lal, is vociferous in attacking the state government, particularly Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal. “We are being punished for not voting for the SAD. They (Badals) claim to have built numerous monuments of religious importance. This all seems to be a pakhand (sham) as they ignored this land — where the two elder Sahibzadas of Guru Gobind Singh were martyred — just because their nominee was rejected by the voters in the Assembly elections,” he says.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); “The government has virtually forgotten this area,” says Sardul Singh, a farmer sitting at a fertiliser shop. “Senior politicians of various parties come here to pay obeisance at Gurdwara Katalgarh Sahib and hold conferences to woo voters during the Jor Mela every year, and yet nothing is done for the betterment of the local people,” he rues. The only big project, a theme park in memory of the Sahibzadas, was initiated by the then Congress government in 2006. “The Akali-BJP sarkar did not provide funds — for obvious reasons. The project would have increased the footfall of devotees and boosted business, but it failed to see the light of day,” says Surinder, a bank employee. Amandeep Singh Mangat, a former Congress kisan cell chairman and councillor, claims that Prem Singh Chandumajra, Akali MP from the Anandpur Sahib seat — under which Chamkaur Sahib constituency falls — has not fulfilled his poll promises of setting up a modern timber market and a cattle market. “Such markets can be a boon for the local farmers and other residents,” he adds. When asked about Channi’s “non-performance”, Rajinder, an electrician in a market at Lutheri village along the Chamkaur Sahib-Morinda road, says it’s the duty of the ruling party to carry out development works. “Being an opposition MLA, Channi had his hands tied,” he argues. He states that a bridge on the Sutlej can bring about a sea change in the lives of residents as there will be direct connectivity with the Ropar-Jalandhar road. An evergreen poll promise, it remains exactly that — a promise. At Morinda, the people reel off their complaints: There is no playground; the only Government Senior Secondary School, located at Sukhomajra village, is 3 km away from the town; and the three roads connecting the town to Ropar, Fatehgarh Sahib and Chamkaur Sahib are in a dilapidated condition. A portion of the school building was declared unsafe two years ago, following which 11 of its 21 rooms were demolished. However, the malba (debris) has not yet been removed from the campus, forget about constructing new rooms. A staff member says their pleas have fallen on deaf ears, even though Education Minister Daljit Singh Cheema is an MLA from the district. The Sikh community is upset over the government’s failure to nail the culprits responsible for the major incidents of sacrilege last year. Jaspreet, a cloth merchant in his twenties, says his family always voted for the SAD, but this time they will opt for Simranjit Singh Mann’s SAD (Amritsar). Reason: The powers that be were powerless in curbing desecration. His brother, Parmeet, says development works were undertaken by the government in other parts of the state, but this constituency never got its due. The roads and streets are waterlogged during the monsoon as the work of laying sewer lines has been going on for the past many years, he complains. Three demonetisation-hit truck drivers are sitting idle, venting their ire on the police. “We have to pay at every naka while transporting goods. If one dares to refuse, the cops slap us,” says Paramjit Singh. His colleague, Jaswinder Singh, says there has been a let-up in extortion by the police from truck drivers in the past few weeks, apparently due to the fast-approaching elections. Then he fires the parting shot: “This proves beyond doubt that the government knows it all and the police are simply obeying orders.”"
"Gagandeep Singh The factory hooter is heard loud and clear as one reaches Jalandhar North constituency. The workers quickly enter the industrial unit’s premises, all set to slog long and hard throughout the day. Everything seems to be happening with clockwork precision. However, once you scratch the surface, the problems surface. The area, which includes the Industrial Focal Point, Focal Point Extension and Transport Nagar, badly needs an effluent treatment plant. “The issue has been taken up with the state government and the Punjab Pollution Control Board several times, but to no avail,” says Charanjit Maingi, an industrialist. “We have been paying heavily for the transportation of effluents to Ludhiana, where these are treated. Jalandhar is also an industrial city. Why can’t a treatment plant be set up here?” he wonders. Maingi also expresses concern over the rising crime rate. “In the first week of the month, when the workers get their salary, several incidents of snatching are reported. Nothing has come out of a series of meetings with the police,” he says. Narinder Saggu, a pump manufacturer, complains that the sewerage system has not been developed to handle the factory outflow. He also flags the knotty issue of compensation for land acquisition. “In the early 1990s, the Punjab Small Industries and Export Corporation provided land to the industrialists after acquiring it from farmers at the rate of Rs 150 per sq yard. Later, the farmers moved the Supreme Court, demanding enhanced compensation. They went on to win the case. The government wants us (industrialists) to pay the money, while we feel the former should do the needful,” he says. According to Saggu, the industrialists have repeatedly taken up the issue with the local MLA, BJP’s KD Bhandari, who is serving his second consecutive term. “Despite his efforts, the matter has not been resolved. It will have a bearing on the elections. The AAP candidate, Gulshan Sharma, himself an iron and steel trader, has assured us of a positive outcome if he is elected,” he adds.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); In the 2007 Assembly election, Bhandari defeated former Congress minister Avtar Henry by about 4,900 votes. In 2012, the margin fell to 1,700-odd votes. He is busy trying to retain his vote bank and minimise the impact of anti-incumbency. “I have been listening to the voters’ grievances and attempting to redress them. Of course, I can’t make everyone happy,” the BJP leader says, adding that development will be his poll plank. Bhandari calls the construction of the railway underbridge in Chandan Nagar his “biggest achievement” during the current term. Des Raj Jassal, a councillor, claims that most of the development works in his ward (No. 1) and others in the constituency have been funded by the Centre. “Not even a single paisa has been spent from the BJP-ruled MC’s budget or the MLA’s fund,” he says, pointing out that there is no plan in place to tackle waterlogging, a major problem faced by the residents. The potholed roads in the Focal Point area continue to be in a state of disrepair. The elections are nearing, but even then no effort is being made to initiate last-ditch damage control. “It’s tough to commute on these roads, especially during the rainy season. The sewers usually remain clogged. Most of the localities become prone to an epidemic outbreak during the monsoon,” says Ashwani Kumar, a local resident. There are more than 500 units in the Industrial Focal Point and Focal Point Extension. Heavy vehicles laden with material ply daily, yet the road infrastructure leaves a lot to be desired. Gurmeet, a resident of Ward No. 7, spews venom: “We live in filthy conditions. The threat of water-borne diseases looms large. We have been suffering for the past couple of decades, but nobody is bothered about us, be it politicians or officials.” Jassal says the drug menace has adversely affected the constituency. “As many as 28 youths aged less than 30 years have died due to drug addiction in my ward in the past five years. Several youngsters have been booked in drug cases, but the big fish are yet to be caught, for reasons best known to the police,” he says, anger writ large on his face."
"Aditi Tandon Tribune News Service New Delhi, November 18 Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan today barred AAP MP Bhagwant Mann from attending the House proceedings for two more weeks, allowing another extension to the parliamentary panel investigating the alleged security breach by him. Mann, 43, has been away from the Lok Sabha since July 25, the day the committee was formed to probe the MP’s “improper conduct” and recommend action. Reacting to the development with a caustic Facebook post and a dharna outside Parliament, Mann called it a “murder of democracy”. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });“I represent 15 lakh people of Sangrur Lok Sabha segment. These people sent me to the country’s biggest panchayat. It is my right to attend the House, but I have again been asked not to come for two weeks. I missed the monsoon session also. I have to speak on demonetisation woes, the SYL canal, the atrocities against Dalits and other issues concerning Punjab and the country. But I am being deliberately being kept outside the House. The PM is afraid of me,” Mann said in his Facebook video. In this social media post, he again defended his act of streaming Parliament security details live, saying that he had only showed “the Parliament gate which mediapersons show all the time”. “What had I done? A BJP MP once entered Parliament with a forged sticker. He was forgiven. I was in my official vehicle with an official driver. The parliamentary committee should submit its report in a time-bound manner. I will accept whatever they say,” Mann said in the post that went viral. The committee headed by BJP member Kirit Somaiya has received a two-week extension starting tomorrow. This is its third extension. Mann has been in the dock for revealing entry points to Parliament, besides some House procedures known only to MPs. He video-recorded these details while travelling from his official residence to Parliament House one morning, and then streamed it all live. The panel is planning to call Mann for another hearing. "
"Sanjeev Singh Bariana Late in the evening, after the Chak Ramsahai mine is closed for the day, Tarsem Lal, a chemist of Sehora village, hears the roar of trucks carrying sand from illegal quarries along the Ravi riverbed. “Officially, sand mining can’t be done after sunset, but our families have to bear the rattle of machinery and vehicles throughout the evening and the night,” he says. Only this mine is operational out of the five in Bhoa constituency, but that’s the official line. A senior officer confides on the condition of anonymity, “There are confirmed reports of illegal mining at certain places, but we don’t have adequate manpower to curb the menace.” Excuse or explanation? That’s anybody’s guess. Jeevam Ram, a retired government official from Polla village, gives us a glimpse of the terror unleashed by the mining mafia. “Reta badmaash chakwande ne. Kise ‘don’ de ishare te kam karde ne. ‘Don’ vi kyee ne, uchchi uchchi thhan te. Raat nu daaru peeti hundi hai  mulazman ne, so asin darde haan. Police aithe aundi nahin te na hi sarkaar. Je sarkaar dilon chhave taan hi kucch ho sakda hai (Sand is illegally lifted at the behest of the don’s goons. There are many influential ‘dons’. The goons get drunk at night… we are scared. Neither the police nor the government comes here. If the government sincerely wants to end this menace, it can be done).” When asked to identify these “dons”, Tarsem Lal says evasively: “Eh saanu na puccho. Pata sarian nu hai (Everyone knows who they are).” Moving ahead, The Tribune team takes a turn, traversing a badly damaged road at Saab Chakk. A truck without a registration number is seen ferrying sand. Azhar Mehmood, who is managing his stables, says, “Pata nahin kaun ne. Hairaani hundi hai, eh main road chhad ke tutti sadak te kitthe jaande ne (I don’t know who they are. I am surprised why they leave the main road and travel on this one).” We can’t say with certainty whether he is expressing ignorance or taking us for a ride.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Prince Pal, a Class-XII passout who works as a motor mechanic, highlights the other ills plaguing the area. “The entire district (Pathankot) has no industry, so no jobs are available. The neighbourhood is flooded with ‘chitta’(drugs). The suppliers, who are outsiders, come in their vehicles and distribute it openly. They keep changing the spot where the addicts are given their daily fix. This is happening right under the nose of the local administration and the police,” says Prince, who is doing a course at a private polytechnic in the hope of bettering his job prospects. The bus stand at Bamial was inaugurated in February last year, but it wears a deserted look. A big settlement near the Indo-Pak border, Bamial has a market that caters to the adjoining areas. Walking through a maze of crowded shops, an elderly Nachhatar Singh wonders why a remote corner of the village was picked to establish the bus stand. “One has to cross the whole market to reach there,” he says, frustration writ large on his face. There are several roads crying for attention, including Bamial-Janial, Janial Chakkk Amir and Dostpur-Kot Bhattian. Ajay Singh, a member of the Taloor village panchayat, says, “Pontoon bridges have come up at places such as Sakol along the border. This still does not solve the problem for a major chunk of the people who are left stranded in their villages, particularly during the monsoon. Getting heavy machinery and luggage here continues to be a big issue. We still need bridges at many other places, including Taash and Mastpur.” According to Hazoori Lal, a social activist, the functioning of the government offices leaves a lot to be desired. The tehsildar office at Bamial opens only once a week, while the one at Narot Jaimal Singh opens only twice, much to the chagrin of the public. “Other offices are no better,” he adds. The scenario is no better in the government hospitals. Ramesh Lal, a retired schoolteacher from Sehora, says, “The hospital in our village caters to nine villages. However, we don’t have even a single doctor on duty.” The government hospital at Bamial, which covers nearly a dozen villages, is only marginally better: It has one doctor and bare-minimum infrastructure. With the code of conduct likely to be announced shortly, BJP MLA Seema Kumari is going all out to get the roads metalled. Surinder Pal, who runs a shop on the Sunderchakk-Bamial road, can see through these last-ditch efforts. He puts it bluntly: “A one-kilometre stretch on the left side of my shop got a concrete layer only day before yesterday. The MLA is in a tearing hurry to erase more than four years of non-performance.” Ram Singh of Anyal village, a wizened old man, knows the political game inside out, having seen it closely over the decades. “Bana te lokan nu moorakh rahe ne par lok ajj kal shauq naal bande ne (These days, people prefer to be befooled),” he says. The way things are, his cynicism is hard to contest."
"Deepkamal Kaur Jalandhar West boasts of a bustling sports goods industry and a leather complex. What it can’t boast of is something quite basic — amenities. The sorry state of affairs is laid bare by the sewerage work in progress on the Kapurthala road, used by tens of thousands of commuters every day. The work has been going on for the past two years, but it seems like an eternity to the residents. “We are not even able to enter our factory from the front gates as the road is dug up. We have been using the rear entrance for the past many months,” says Rajesh Kharbanda, who owns the Nivia sports factory. “It’s a big hassle for us. Our business is affected as visitors from other states — or countries — are put off by the mess. But we have still not lost hope of ‘achhe din’ as a top-class road is expected to come up,” he adds like a never-say-die optimist. Encompassing seven areas set up during the Mughal era and including several congested localities associated with the economically weaker sections, Jalandhar West is categorised as an “urban” constituency. But the irony is not lost on anyone. The 120-ft road, named after its width, is used by the residents of Basti Sheikh and Basti Danishmandan. Heavily potholed, it turns riverine during the monsoon, with virtually no provision for rainwater drainage. What pains the voters is the fact that their constituency is represented by the BJP’s seniormost Cabinet minister — Bhagat Chunni Lal — and yet their lives have not changed for the better (state BJP chief and Union Minister of State Vijay Sampla, too, has his house in this reserved seat, but that also hasn’t improved things). Vijay Dhir, a factory owner, says, “People had high hopes from Chunni Lal, especially because he had himself worked in a sports goods factory. The Bhagat community — Kabir followers and the predominant group here — became all the more confident when he became the Local Bodies Minister. But his 15-year-long tenure has been a huge letdown. Now, with age and health no longer on his side, his ‘Shrawan Putra’ (Chunni Lal’s hyperactive son Mahinder Bhagat) wants the ticket. Let’s see what fate has in store for him.” Mahinder is quick to defend his father. “He won the seat in 1997, 2007 (called Jalandhar South before delimitation) and 2012. People are free to say anything, but we invested Rs 100 crore through the Punjab Infrastructure Development Board (PIDB) recently on roads and sewerage. About 60 per cent of the works are over.”(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); He promises that the Kapurthala road would get carpeted in a month. “I admit that the sewerage work has got delayed, but once it’s over, the road will be as good as any national highway and people’s problems will become a thing of the past,” he says, already talking like a candidate in the thick of campaigning. Racing against time, the ruling party leaders have tried to woo the industry by setting up a Skill Development Centre for tannery workers at the Leather Complex, which is likely to be inaugurated in the coming days. “This is the only good thing that has happened to us as we hope to get trained labour. Otherwise, it has been years since the drums in the wet units were sealed by the Punjab Pollution Control Board and our work capacity has been reduced to less than half. No politician came to our rescue during the tough times,” says Raju Virk, a tannery owner. The foundation stone of another skill centre, named after Kabir, to train construction workers was laid on the 120-ft road earlier this year. “The work had just started when it was suspended due to a technical glitch in the Rs 10-crore project,” alleges Congress councillor Sushil Rinku, a ticket-seeking Ravidassia. A shopkeeper in Abadpura locality says bitterly, “If Chunni Lal has done us no good, his rival, former Congress minister Mohinder Singh Kaypee, hasn’t been any better. The latter’s family remained in the saddle for 45-long years. Post-delimitation, his house now falls under Jalandhar Cantonment constituency and he has lost his base here.” He agrees that some people still have sympathy for Kaypee because his MLA father Darshan Singh Kaypee was gunned down by militants, but hastens to add that the residents are looking for change this time. Revealing his AAP leanings, he says, “Most people here, including me, are Kabir followers and Darshan Bhagat is a candidate from our own community,” even as a customer at his shop observes that the recent rally of state AAP convener Gurpreet Singh Waraich in favour of the candidate was not exactly a crowd-puller. The area residents believe that the caste factor will be decisive. “Of the about 1.5 lakh voters, half are from the reserved category: 30,000 Bhagats, 30,000 Ravidassias, 10,000 Valmiks and around 5,000 Brars. Whichever community has two candidates representing the main political parties will suffer as the votes will get divided and the third one will have an edge,” a local politician claims. Vipan Kumar, a resident of Babrik Chowk area, says the scenario is fluid at present. “It’s difficult to say at the moment which way the voters will go. People are still making up their minds.” For him, the best thing that has happened in the past five years is a mini civil hospital coming up on the 120-ft road. “It was difficult travelling all the way to the Civil Hospital at the other end of the city. The 30-bed hospital in our area will be a big boon for us,” he says. But he knows that his enthusiasm is not matched by the ground reality. With the code of conduct looming large, the government may not be able to open the hospital, whose basic structure is barely ready. Vipan will have to wait indefinitely, something that he and the other voters around him have been doing for years, if not decades."
"Moga, October 18 Farmers today blocked traffic on the Moga-Jalandhar National Highway No. 71 at the Kawan Wala Pattan barrage for many hours in protest against reckless and illegal extraction of sand by the mining mafia from the Sutlej river. They alleged that the unscientific and uncontrolled mining operations threatened their livelihood, posing risks of soil erosion on their fields and in residential areas as these could lead to floods during the monsoon. Harbans Singh Sahota, sarpanch of Kamalke Khurd village, who led the protest, alleged that they were forced to block the highway today because of the insensitive attitude of the administration towards the problems being faced by them. He said the illegal mining operations on the other side of the river in Jalandhar district had increased the flow of water towards Moga, posing threat to the fields and settlements. — TNS "
"Tribune News Service Chandigarh, October 13 In a repeat of their night stay at the Vidhan Sabha during the recent monsoon session, Congress MLAs tonight decided to stay put outside the CM’s residence in protest against the alleged assault – and police inaction — on party workers in Ludhiana on Dasehra eve. They demanded action against Police Commissioner JS Aulakh and SP Jaswinder Singh, accusing them of inaction even as Akalis attack Congress workers. The MLAs refused to listen to CM Parkash Singh Badal, who came out twice to assure them that the erring SP would be sent on leave. Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu said they would not budge from the spot till action was taken against all erring police officers.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Over 10 MLAs were camping outside the CM’s house. State party affairs incharge Asha Kumari paid a visit, while PPCC president Capt Amarinder Singh is expected to meet them tomorrow. Jakhar said by taking offensive to the use of word “chitta”, the Akalis were themselves admitting to their connection with the drug menace. Raising slogans against the government, the Congress leaders demanded immediate suspension of the SP and transfer of the Police Commissioner. They alleged the police were biased as they booked six Congressmen for attempt to murder, including DCC president Gurpreet Gogi, who was injured in the clash.  Jakhar sought reply from the CM on whether any instructions had been passed by the administration about the specific colour code of the effigy of the demons. He termed the attack by Akalis as “surgical strike” on Congress workers."
"Sarbjit Dhaliwal Tribune News Service Chandigarh, September 28 Even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has favoured maximising the internal use of three rivers, the Indus, Jhelum and the Chenab, that are part of the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan, the Punjab Government’s Irrigation Department engineers have showed their concern over the flow of the Ravi waters to Pakistan downstream Madhopur Headworks in Pathankot district. They want that the work on the Shahpur Kandi dam project be resumed to stop the flow of water to Pakistan, besides bringing more area under irrigation in Jammu region and enhancing the irrigation capacity in Punjab. The Ravi water was to be pooled at the proposed balancing reservoir by raising the dam with an estimated cost of Rs 800 crore at Shahpur Kandi, about 11 km downstream the Ranjit Sagar dam.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Half of this reservoir was to be made in Punjab territory and the other part in Jammu and Kashmir. The land for the project was acquired years ago and the Centre was to fund 90 per cent of the project. However, following objections by the J&K Government, the work was suspended two years ago. Consequently, whenever excess water is released from the Ranjit Sagar dam in the Ravi, especially during summer months, a good amount of water flows to Pakistan via Madhopur Headworks in the absence of a balancing reservoir at Shahpur Kandi.  Dr GS Dhillon, former chief engineer, Irrigation Department, said: “The balancing reservoir should have been completed even before the Ranjit Sagar dam.” In summer, when the demand for power goes up, all hydro-power units installed at the Ranjit Sagar dam are made operational. To operate turbines about 15,000 cusecs of water has to be released. Of this, 12,000 cusecs is released into the Upper Bari Doab Canal and Madhopur-Beas Link Canals at Madhopur Headworks and the remaining flows to Pakistan. During the monsoon, sometimes floodgates of the Ranjit Sagar dam have to be opened due to topping up of the reservoir. Again, the water goes to the neighbouring country. The J&K Government has taken the plea that since the Punjab Government has terminated the River Waters Sharing Agreement in 2004, the previous agreement relating to the Ranjit Sagar dam and Shahpur Kandi dam between Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir too have become defunct. The Punjab Government has taken up this issue with the Centre asking it intervene, but the J&K Government has refused to budge from its stand. Kahan Singh Pannu, Irrigation Secretary, Punjab, said the state government had been trying hard to convince the J&K Government over the matter, but to no avail. He said if the project was completed, it would bring additional 65,000 hectares of land under irrigation in Jammu region, besides stopping the flow of Ravi waters to Pakistan."
"Tribune News Service Chandigarh, September 22 With 182 new cases of dengue reported today, the total number of cases in the state has reached 2,218. The Health Department’s infrastructure is bursting at the seams. Following Mohali, Amritsar is the worst-affected district with 393 cases. However, the ground reality in Amritsar tells the tale of complete failure of the Municipal Corporation. The MC should have started fogging when the monsoon began, but it started the process only last week.

MLA Sadu Singh Dharamsot, who enacted Deputy CM, showered praises on Sunil Jakhar while advising him not to side with the Opposition benches. OP Soni, MLA from Amritsar, drew attention of the “Speaker” towards the urban issues. Even in the mock session, Sunil Jakhar took the role of main speaker along with Channi, who preferred to mark himself as the Leader of the Opposition.

Though the water level in the Sutlej is under control this time due to insufficient rains in catchment areas, holes created by rodents has been a matter of concern. Deputy Commissioner DPS Kharbanda, who along with drainage officials carried out inspection of the bundh, said the holes and burrows if not plugged could cause potential threat, hence this exercise of providing killer pets had been initiated. In the Makhu block, the Agriculture Department staff has already started distributing this medicine in villages which are prone to floods.

Then, they announced to stage a three-day protest in Badal village starting on January 22. The police, besides cordoning off the village and the village gurdwara where the farmers had gathered on Wednesday, also rounded up some leaders of the Punjab Kisan Union and Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) Dkaunda. Mansa SSP Raghubir Singh Sandhu confirmed that some farmer leaders have been arrested under Sections 107/151 of the CrPC (preventive custody).(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); DSP Bathinda Harmeek Deol said, “The police cordoned off the gurdwara where farmers had gathered in large numbers.” Fighting for a long time to get appropriate compensation for the cotton crop damaged by the whitefly attack earlier this season, these farmers had earlier held a series of rallies to press for their demands. Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan, state general secretary, BKU Ekta Ugraha, said, “Our demands, including compensation of Rs 40,000 per acre to farmers and Rs 20,000 per family to farm labourers,  could curb farmer suicides.” Village turns into fortress Badal: As a large number of farmers and farm labourers today reached Rai Ke Kalan village in Bathinda district to gherao Badal village, situated 7 km away, from January 22 to 24, the district police have beefed up security in this VVIP village, converting it into a fortress. A large number of policemen have been deployed in and around the village."
"Praful Chander Nagpal Tribune News Service Fazilka, January 16The dilapidated house has no door. “You never know, an angel might just walk in,” says Harbans Kaur. The 66-year-old is prone to delivering profound one-liners. It’s her way, perhaps, of maintaining sanity. “I can’t even commit suicide, someone has to take care of my seven-year-old grandson and young daughter-in-law,” she says with a terse expression, as she sits on a broken cot in her dingy house situated along a stinking pond in Pakkan village. Like Harbans Kaur, her widowed daughter-in-law Harpreet Kaur does not lift her gaze from the open entrance. “An angel just might walk in,” the matriarch repeats herself.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Harbans Kaur’s husband Piara Singh was 55 when he committed suicide 12 years back by consuming pesticides, leaving behind a debt for the family to fend for. Their two sons followed in his footsteps. Eldest son Lakhwinder Singh (34) committed suicide by consuming pesticides in 2013. He was a bachelor. Three weeks ago, on December 21, Harbans Kaur’s married son Nirvail Singh (32), the youngest of the three brothers, ended his life, also by consuming poison. Left behind are his mother, brother Jarnail Singh, wife Harpreet Kaur (29), son Navjot (7) and a family debt of Rs 6 lakh. The family had a small landholding of 18 kanals, divided into three shares. The commission agents, a father-son duo, got 3 kanals transferred in their name in lieu of a loan, says Harbans Kaur. Having executed the sale deed of small chunks of land, they allegedly took benefit of the family’s ignorance and got deposited a bank cheque signed by Nirvail Singh. It bounced. Fearing action, and in acute stress, Nirvail Singh consumed pesticide, says Harbans Kaur. After the suicide, the commission agents, from Arniwala in Fazilka district, were booked for abetting suicide. “The village has witnessed three dozen suicides in the past 15 years. There have been consecutive crop failure, and problems of debt and poverty are getting worse, not better,” says Dharmpal Singh, the village sarpanch. Pakkan village is home to nearly 4,000 people, majority of them marginal farmers and labourers. It is the last village of Fazilka district rubbing shoulders with Muktsar district, and falls under the Jalalabad Assembly segment, represented by Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal. “He never visited the village to express his sympathy with any grieving family,” says a village elder, Mukhtiar Singh. “The small rivulet, Landi Kassi of Bhagsar minor, for the tail-end village remains insufficient for irrigation of cotton crop. The sub-soil water is brackish and unfit for irrigation. The topography of the village also adds to the misery of the small farmers. During the monsoon season, the excess water from Muktsar area flows to this village and inundates the crops as it is a low-lying area,” says Nachhtar Singh, a former sarpanch. Of the total of 3,200 acres of land in the village, over 1,000 acres have been rendered barren. “The crop damage due to inundation is a regular feature,” he adds. “None of the debt-ridden families of farmers who committed suicide has ever been paid any compensation by the government. It is the vicious circle of debt in which they continue to remain trapped,” points out a social activist of the village, Jaswinder Singh.  Pakkan village has no government dispensary or veterinary centre. A primary school was upgraded five years ago. “Besides the problems of poverty and debt, most villagers are afflicted with hepatitis B and C,” says Jaswinder Singh. No survey, he claims, has ever been conducted about the deceased and the ailing. “The entire chunk of small landholdings in the village has been mortgaged to financiers.” I thought it prudent to ask Additional Deputy Commissioner Charandev Singh Maan about the village. “The government is in the process of identifying the deceased farmers and would give every possible help to their kin,” he said. I thought of sharing this bit of news with Harbans Kaur, but again, thought it wise not to give false hope. As I get up to leave and fold my hands, Harbans Kaur looks at me and then at the open door. “An angel just might walk in,” she mutters. About time."

"Vijay Mohan Tribune News Service Chandigarh, October 19 The Bhakra Beas Management Committee (BBMB) is chalking out a plan to deplete the water level in the Bhakra and Pong Dam reservoirs. The move that aims at inspecting the submerged parts of the structures is being opposed by the partner states. As per recommendations of 4th Dam Safety Committee, the plan to inspect the Bhakra Dam was put up before the technical committee earlier this year, but the partner states did not give their nod, citing high demand for water in their respective areas. The affected states are Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and New Delhi, which receive potable water from the BBMB. Water for irrigation is also drawn from the committee.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The BBMB’s dams and projects on the Sutlej and the Beas also generate hydro-power for the northern grid. Depleting storage levels will affect both, water supply for irrigation as well as power generation, till the time the level is brought up. The inspection will require bringing the level of the Bhakra Dam reservoir on the Sutlej to its dead storage level of 1,462 feet – about 220 feet lower than its maximum capacity – for experts to study the state and health of the trash racks, penstocks, river outlets and other submerged installations. “The inspection may have been done just once or twice since Bhakra was commissioned in 1963. It has definitely not been done in the last three decades,” a senior BBMB official said.” “The exercise is important as we need to examine the structures which are otherwise inaccessible. It will also give us the opportunity to study the impact of deflection of the dam due to the immense water pressure. We are taking up the issue with the partner states again,”  he said. The BBMB is also mulling over inspecting the Pong Dam in April 2016. The water level in the reservoir on the Beas will be reduced to 1,300 feet (maximum limit is 1,390 feet) for the inspection of submerged installations and the penstock tunnel portion upstream of the emergency gate up to the intake structure. After the monsoon is over, the reservoirs depletion period begins as inflow of water is cut down due to deficient rain or melting of snow."
"Saurabh Malik Tribune News Service Chandigarh, September 28 In a significant judgment that may change the way the police handle rape cases, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has made it clear that investigating agencies should be trained to be sensitive and prompt. They should also be oriented to help victims and their families. The clarion call came in a case, where two teens were raped. The High Court observed that the case reflected an insensitive approach of local police in not promptly reacting to rape of two girls in their early teens in disregard to public outcry requiring quick action against the rapists. “Such incidents leave a deep scar on the mind of girls in our society. It is high time that investigating agencies are properly oriented to be sensitive and to react promptly to such situations. The delay in police action can always leave scope for tinkering with the exact version than the one projected in the court,” the High Court asserted.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The assertion comes at a time when an average of three rapes are daily reported in Punjab, with Ludhiana topping the list with an average of two rapes reported every week. The latest figures tabled during the recently-concluded Monsoon Session of the State Assembly make it clear that no less than 3,146 rape cases were registered from 2012 till August 31 this year. Shockingly, just 595 cases ended in conviction at the rate of 0.2 per cent. As the case came up for hearing, the High Court was told that the teens were raped in January 2009. The girls had gone to a boys’ school for Republic Day function, after which they went near Kangra Club at Pahari market in Nangal. They were returning home when accused-appellant Vishal and a juvenile started following them before taking the girls to a vacant house and raping them. Dismissing Vishal appeal against seven years rigorous imprisonment sentence, Justice R. P. Nagrath asserted the story of three-four unidentified boys surrounding the girls along with the two accused was propounded by the investigating agency either to blackmail some more boys or to help the accused during the trial. But the appellant’s identity could not be doubted."
"Anirudh Gupta Ferozepur, September 27 Having moved away from traditional crop cycle, the farmers who had switched over to basmati are feeling trapped between the devil and the deep sea. The crumbling price of Basmati 1509 variety — which has already arrived in the market this season — has crushed the farmers’ hopes, putting their very survival at stake. In a late reaction, the Union government has now approved procuring the Basmati 1509 variety ‘Grade A’ at the prevailing MSP (Rs 1,450) of the non-basmati paddy variety. But many farmers have already sold off their produce at prices ranging from Rs 900-1,200 which is much less than their actual input cost. Last season, the 1509 variety had fetched anything between Rs 1,800 and Rs 2,200. However, erroneous policies juxtaposed with the drop in exports and higher moisture content due to monsoon showers have brought the prices on the mat. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Till date, all efforts by the government to coerce rice shellers to buy this variety at rates close to MSP have proved futile. This has invited the wrath of the farmers who are forced to sell their produce at ""dirt cheap prices"". ""In order to break away from sowing traditional crops, I had sown 1509 Basmati, anticipating good remuneration. To my bad luck, there are no takers in the market,"" said Gurjant Singh of Mamdot. ""I am wondering how I will repay loans and make both ends meet,"" said a disappointed Gurjant.  Gurpreet Singh, Sarpanch of Hajiwala village, expressed similar views. ""The farmers who had sown 1509 are feeling dejected as they will not be able to recover even their input costs. Earnings and savings are just dreams,"" he said. ""If the cotton fiasco made our condition bad, this has made it worse. The yield of 1509 is around 18-20 quintal per acre which is less than the non-basmati variety (28-32 quintals),"" said Gurpreet. ""In Ferozepur and neighbouring districts, not much damage has been reported due to rain. But the waning prices hit the farmers hard,"" said Gurnaib Singh. ""Even the MSP of Rs 1,450 will not be enough. The government should come out with some relief package to bail us out"" he demanded.  Another farmer Nihal Singh of Machibugra village said that he had sown Basmati 1509 on his five-acre land which cost him around Rs 16,000 per acre. ""We farmers expect at least Rs 2,000 profit to survive and sustain our family. Otherwise, we will be doomed,"" he said. Already various farmer unions have launched an agitation blaming both the state and central government for the ""mess"". Union leader Baldev Singh said that anti-farmer policies of the government were ruining their lives. He said that if the government didn't revise the price of basmati, the famers will be forced to intensify their agitation. While the farmers are feeling the heat, the exporters are treading cautiously. Sameer Mittal, managing director of Bhagwati Lacto Vegetarian Exports Ltd, said that the additional 7.25 per cent tax, including market fee, rural development fee, infrastructure fund and cancer cess imposed by the state government besides withdrawal of 2 per cent incentive on exports by the central government have dented their export prospects. ""We are now waiting for the market in Iran to open up, which, besides other Gulf nations, has been a big export destination for us,"" he said."
"Ruchika M Khanna Tribune News Service Chandigarh, September 25 The monsoon session of Punjab Vidhan Sabha that concluded yesterday has given each of the three main political parties in Punjab a reason to introspect. For it brought to fore infighting within the Congress and BJP, besides poor policy planning by the Akali Dal leading to dismay amongst party MLAs. If MLAs of the ruling alliance were concerned about the government policies not favouring their vote bank, the Congress camp was seen (unsuccessfully) fighting factionalism and trying to project itself as a formidable Opposition. But the Congress was not alone battling the divide within the party. The first day of the Assembly session saw BJP MLAs take on their party ministers for allegedly succumbing to the Akali diktat in formulating government policy, in turn hurting the party's vote bank.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The verbal duel between Industry and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Madan Mohan Mittal and Manoranjan Kalia was precisely on this account (for failure to oppose infrastructure cess on electricity and transfer of immovable property). Complaints made by MLAs against Local Bodies Minister Anil Joshi were also concerning his inability to ratify resolutions passed by local bodies in BJP dominated seats, which could help the party gain votes. In the SAD camp, MLAs raised their concerns over the curtailing of social security schemes, after government verification drives. Be it the atta-dal scheme or distribution of social security pensions or the non-implementation of the reservation policy in contractual government jobs, the Akali Dal found itself cornered by its own men, even in the House. When party ministers came under attack not just from the Congress but also from independents MLAs Balwinder Singh Bains and Simarjit Singh Bains, they were literally left to fend for themselves. The Congress, however, managed to take the cake with the fight within the party MLAs being played out in the House on the last day of the session, much to the glee of the ruling Akali Dal- BJP government. The strong case the Leader of Opposition Sunil Jakhar built against the government over rampant corruption in the agriculture department leading to the agrarian crisis in the state was washed away with Congress MLA Ashwani Sekhri accusing two of his own party MLAs — Sangat Singh Gilzian and Ramajit Singh Sikki —threatening him, thus inviting action against them by Speaker Charanjit Singh Atwal."
"Ruchika M Khanna Tribune News Service Chandigarh, September 24 The ruling Akali-BJP government was spared an onslaught by the Opposition Congress on the last day of the monsoon session of Punjab Vidhan Sabha today, with the Congressmen choosing to fight among themselves in the House. Though Congress MLAs managed to create their share of noise in the House — which led to one adjournment for 25 minutes and the session boycott later — the case they had built against the government yesterday by targeting three Akali ministers over “irregularities” went crumbling amid infighting. Yesterday’s episode of Batala Congress MLA Ashwani Sekhri being booed by his party MLAs reverberated during the zero hour today. While Sekhri demanded action against two of his party’s MLAs — Ramanjit Singh Sikki and Sangat Singh Gilzian — for threatening him, the Congress strategy moved from taking on the government to quelling the tensions within the Congress Legislature Party (CLP).(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Though senior party MLAs tried to pacify Sekhri and told the Speaker that they would solve the issue among themselves, the Speaker referred the case to the Privileges Committee of the House. To counter the government, the Congress had planned to take up issues such as drug menace and the alleged involvement of BJP leaders in the illicit drug trade; a privilege motion against Minister for Backward Classes and Scheduled Castes Gulzar Singh Ranike; and the Punjab Chief Minister’s reply to the charges of “man-made” crisis in agriculture because of rampant corruption in the Agriculture Department. As Sekhri narrated the incident, some MLAs supported him, while others, including Leader of Opposition Sunil Jakhar, Lal Singh, Rana Gurjit Singh, Ajit Inder Singh Mofar and Sukhjinder Randhawa, were seen trying to pacify all in the Opposition benches. While Parliamentary Affairs Minister Madan Mohan Mittal said it was a serious matter, Revenue Minister Bikram Majithia said if the member of the House felt threatened, security must be provided to him. On this, Jakhar said the “internal matter of the Congress” was being politicised unnecessarily. Mittal said since Sekhri had not withdrawn his submission to the House, his “izzat” was in the hands of the Speaker, who asked Sekhri to name the MLAs. Sekhri said the names had appeared in the newspaper today, before finally naming Sikki and Gilzian. When Congress MLA from Ferozepur Parminder Singh raised the issue of drug menace, he was interrupted by Akali MLA Virsa Singh Valtoha who questioned him about the Congress’ stand on legalising poppy husk vends, based on a statement made by a Congress leader in Tarn Taran a few days ago. This led to a slanging match between the two sides and raising of slogans, forcing the Speaker to adjourn the House. This time was used by the Congress to pacify Sekhri, who later said all was well after the two MLAs apologised to him. Later, Jakhar told mediapersons that the matter was internal and was resolved internally. When the proceedings resumed and CM Parkash Singh Badal clarified the charges leveled against his government on the “man-made” agrarian crisis, the Opposition led by Jakhar demanded that the CM first explain his stand on the issue of a farmer, Kuldeep Singh, who committed suicide in Bathinda today. With the Speaker disallowing this interruption, the Congress MLAs boycotted the House."

A lot of public funds were wasted. We need to tell the people about the Congress’s blunder,” he said.  Earlier, the Union Minister also led a BJP protest against the Congress outside the mini secretariat. While addressing a small gathering, Katheria defended the SAD-BJP alliance for working for the state. Kamal Sharma, BJP state president, said the Congress had not come to terms with its humiliating defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, last year. On whether he would resign after his PA’s has been arrested in a drugs case, he said, “Why should I quit? He was not my PA. The moment I got to know about his involvement in the case, I sacked him. Now the law will take its course.”     Harsimrat’s onion remark draws flak    Phagwara: Senior Congress leader Sukhpal Khaira criticised Union Minister Harsimrat Badal for telling the poor to consume less onions as their prices were soaring. Kharia alleged this was cruel joke on the people. In a press release issued today, Khaira said this statement of Harsimrat reflected her feudal mindset. Khaira alleged Harsimrat, instead of devising methods to control the prices of onions and contain inflation, had the audacity to play with the sentiments of the poor.  He said since the Badal family had amassed a lot of wealth, its members were oblivious to the pain and suffering of the poor. He further said, while the poor were being paid a meagre Rs 200-250 per day under MGNREGA, Harsimrat made Rs 3 crore per annum from just one business venture i.e. the Orbit Resorts. "

"Varinder Singh Tribune News Service Chandigarh, August 17 Former Chief Minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal today toughened her stance against veteran Congress leader Capt Amarinder Singh saying that instead of spending time in Punjab, he should not have led the party from the front in the Lok Sabha’s monsoon session. She said Amarinder should have taken the BJP government to task on the issue of GST. Bhattal’s attack on senior party leader assumes significance as she has sought to assert herself at a time when both Captain and PPCC chief Partap Singh Bajwa are involved in a bitter fight over the control of the state unit. The Congress leadership is said to have almost made up its mind to put an end to the factionalism in its state unit by taking some drastic step on the issue.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Bhattal’s newfound assertion has popped up immediately after she spent the past three days in Delhi and meet top party leaders, including AICC president Sonia Gandhi. Bhattal has also sought to play a “shrewd” move by suggesting the leadership to form a coordination committee for Punjab to “iron out small differences” between the senior leaders and to go for an early distribution of tickets so as to give the party an edge ahead of the 2017 Assembly poll. In the same breath, Bhattal said the party stood united and that every Congress leader was working to uproot the “tyrannical” SAD-BJP regime. “I was never in the race for the top slot, but at the same time, I would not shirk if the leadership entrusts any responsibility on me. We need to fight a tactical battle if we want to throw the SAD-BJP out of power in 2017,” she said. Amarinder, meanwhile, sought to repulse the attack by advising Bhattal to “better keep her opinion to herself, particularly when it has neither been solicited nor required.” Amarinder, who had asserted that GST was important for Punjab, alleged Bhattal did not understand the urgency and importance of GST for the state. “She does not seem to be bothered about Punjab’s economy which should otherwise be everybody’s concern,” he said."
"Ruchika M Khanna Tribune News Service Chandigarh, August 14 By “subtly” expressing his displeasure over the delay in the roll out of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), Congress Deputy Leader in the Lok Sabha Capt Amarinder Singh has actually expressed his displeasure with the party leadership. With the Congress being blamed by the NDA for the complete washout of the monsoon session of Parliament and for stalling the passage of the GST Bill, Amarinder’s statement is set to have far wider political connotations and ramifications, especially in Punjab. In a statement issued here today, Amarinder “ …expressed his displeasure over the delay in the introduction and passage of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill… Whatever the reasons and circumstances have been during the monsoon session, the GST should have been allowed to be introduced in Parliament to facilitate the way for its eventual passage”.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The former Chief Minister said Punjab would suffer the most due to the delay in the passage of the GST Bill as the state was passing through a critical economic phase where it did not have enough money to pay even staff salaries and service its debts. “The introduction of the GST Bill, which is originally a brainchild of the Congress, could have proved mutually beneficial for the industry and the state. On the one hand it would have streamlined and uniformed the tax regime and on the other it would have generated additional revenue and resources for the state,” he said. Punjab would now have to wait for an uncertain period of time before GST became a reality, he said. This is the third time in a row that the former Chief Minister of Punjab has created a stir in political circles by taking an aim at the party’s top leadership. Upset at the issue of Punjab Congress’ leadership not being resolved and his frequent shows of strength failing to impress the party high command into changing the state’s leadership, Amarinder has been issuing statements that hit the party high command directly. He did not attend monsoon session of Parliament. He was conspicuous by his frequent absence in the previous session of Parliament, too. On being questioned why he failed to attend the monsoon session, he recently told a television channel that holding rallies and mobilising Congress workers in Punjab was more important than sitting in dharnas outside Parliament. Amarinder, who has managed to win over most of the Congress MLAs and has been holding rallies and well-attended mass contact programmes, had earlier spoken against the elevation of Rahul Gandhi as the party president. His relationship with Rahul Gandhi, vis a vis his bête noir and Punjab Congress chief Partap Singh Bajwa’s relation with the Gandhi scion, are not very cordial and his statement against Rahul’s elevation had not been taken too kindly by the powers that be in the Congress. These three factors together have once again led to speculation in political circles on whether Amarinder would explore the possibility of going it on his own before the next Assembly elections in Punjab. Sources close to the former Chief Minister say though Amarinder has proved beyond doubt that he is the tallest leader in the Punjab Congress and perhaps the only one who can take on the Badals, the party high command is unwilling to yield in his favour. Though people close to Amarinder refuse to comment on whether he will go on his own in future, they do say that it is “an idea the time for which has not come”."

"Kulwinder Sandhu Tribune News Service Moga, August 3 Most of the natural drains in Moga district have not been cleaned by the drainage wing of the irrigation department, reportedly due to paucity of funds, even as the monsoon season is underway. Though the Moga district has received below normal rainfall so far, but weather experts have predicted moderate to heavy rainfall in this area in the coming days. Villagers familiar with the situation in the monsoon season say many drains are choked at several places due to weed and silt.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); The natural drains at Badhni Kalan, Lopo, Raoke Kalan, Rania and other nearby villages; besides, another drain on the Bohna road on the outskirts of Moga city have been neglected by the authorities.

"GS Paul Tribune News Service Pathankot, August 3 Nothing much has changed in the vulnerable Bamiyal sector a week after the Dinanagar terror attack. A high-profile team of the Border Security Force had visited some of the pockets at Paharipur outpost on July 30 as the Global Positioning System (GPS) seized from the militants had pointed towards the Bamiyal sector touching Pakistan. The border township of Dinanagar is sandwiched between Gurdaspur and Pathankot. Around 22 km away is Bamiyal which is vulnerable to infiltration.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Earlier too, intruders have crossed over from this point. Bamiyal shares borders with the Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir. A week after the Dinanagar terror attack, the situation remains as it was earlier. No efforts to fill the gaps in border security of the key Bamiyal sector could be noticed. Though there are watch towers and new forward posts are coming up, yet a sizeable stretch of the Indo-Pak border is negligibly guarded. The seasonal rivulets at the Indo-Pak border, scant vigil to check the cross-border infiltration and the suspected role of the Gujjar community deras along the border are some of the issues that call for immediate attention. Three rivulets — Ujh, Jalalia and Tarnah — flowing from Jammu and Kashmir merge into the Ravi at a place called Mararah Pattan, before flowing towards Pakistan. Due to its zigzag flow, it flows back to the Indian side. During monsoon, the water level goes up. This results in the weakening of the border fence over it, facilitating the sneaking in of trained intruders. Route terrorists took Though the security agencies have not officially announced the route that led the terrorists to Dinanagar, yet an official, on the condition of anonymity, said that the terrorists entered through Pahari Pur and swam across the Ravi to reach Mararah Pattan. As per GPS analysis, they probably went towards Bala Pind-Narot Jaimal Singh-Makaura- Bharath-Balaur-Dholowal. They must have walked towards Chottu Ram Mandir which is just 200m ahead of the Dinanagar railway line where the bomb was planted. From there, the Dinanagar bus stand is just a km away. Then, they shot dead their first target — Amarjit Singh, who runs a ‘chhole-kulcha’ joint near the bus stand — on July 27. A few metres ahead, they snatched the car of dhaba owner Kamaljit Singh Matharoo after injuring him. After making a bid to intercept a PRTC bus, they barged into the police station. Vulnerable points Though BSF’s posts and watch towers are in Bhopalpur village, yet a sizeable portion of the L-shaped fence was found to be broken. The part of the fence on the rivulet had been swept away, but instead of mending it, a stop-gap arrangement was made with the help of wild shrubs. Gujjar deras Questions are being raised as to how the Gujjar community escaped being the targets of the terrorists. The local residents said that makeshift Gujjar deras are found at secluded spots of almost all villages along the Indo-Pak border. They allege that the Gujjar deras acted as conduit for terrorists from the other side. The Gujjars enjoy political patronage and hence, the defence forces expressed their inability to displace them. The Gurdaspur police have recently rounded up several persons belonging to the Gujjar community for questioning. SSP Pathankot Rakesh Kaushal said that displacing the Gujjars was under the jurisdiction of the government. “On our part, we have launched a drive to check their antecedents. Their photographs are also being clicked to maintain their record,” he said."

They also complained that the work on laying the drain pipe as promised by the Chief Minister in 2013 was yet to begin. Harmandeep Kaur, Sarpanch, Haraj village, said, “We have met the officials concerned a number of times, but to no avail. Neither any drain has been carved out, nor a drain pipe laid. Water has started accumulating in our fields.

Moreover, there was always a risk of crop loss due to uncertain weather, he said, adding that in such a case, the government gave relief to the landowners and not the actual growers. To get back this relief amount from the land owner back is a difficult task for the lessee, said Gurmeet Singh, a farmer of Duareana village in Faridkot.

"Sarbjit Dhaliwal Tribune News Service Chandigarh, January 23 With the Centre setting the alarm bells ringing on declining water table in the state, the government here is in a dilemma on breaking free from the traditional paddy-wheat cycle. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Water Resources Minister Uma Bharti have expressed concern over depleting water table in the state. Bharti intends to meet Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal to tell him to stop paddy cultivation as it consumes a lot of water. Former Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar had also advised Badal against growing paddy. His rationale was that rice-eating states would soon become self-dependent and there would be no buyers of paddy being grown in Punjab. Pawar held a meeting with Badal to discuss the diversification plan prepared by the state government to move away from the wheat-paddy cycle. “We are fully seized of the matter and have already initiated steps to diversify,” said Suresh Kumar, Financial Commissioner (Development). The state was treading cautiously on the diversification front as it concerned the livelihood of 1.5 million farmer families, besides several lakh other people, he said. “We are working to provide appropriate alternatives to ensure good returns to farmers concerned,” he said.  (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });Punjab grows paddy and basmati in about 27.5 lakh hectares and wheat in about 35 lakh hectares. As per the latest data gathered by the Central Ground Water Board during the last paddy season, the water table went down in 77 per cent of the total area (about 50,000 sq km). It went down by 2 m in 65 per cent area and 2 to 4 m in the remaining area. There was a rise in the water table in 23 per cent area (Muktsar-Abohar). From November 2013 to November 2014, water table went down in 78 per cent area. The fall was up to 2 m in 74 per cent area and from 2 to 4 m in the remaining 4 per cent area. Water table went up in 22 per cent area. Poor rainfall this year was also a major reason behind the decline in the water table. It was below average by 50 per cent. In fact, the rainfall was above normal only in 2008 during the last 10 years. Of the total 143 blocks in the state, 123 are known as dark blocks as far as water table is concerned. Of the total land area, only 3.1 per cent (1,450 sq km) can be technically called waterlogged. The area where the water table is between 0 to 2 m from the surface level is called waterlogged.  The water table in the state is from 2 to 5 m in 5,449 sq km; 5 to 10 m in 9,785 sq km; 10 to 20 m in 18,286 sq km; 20 to 30 m in 10,549 sq km; 30 to 40 m in 4,434 sq km. To break free from the paddy-wheat cycle, the state government had submitted a diversification plan involving an expenditure of Rs 8,000 crore to the Centre. As the Centre has not extended any worthwhile support in that regard, the state is struggling to make headway in that direction. The area under common varieties of paddy has come down by 33 per cent, while there has been a significant increase in the area under basmati. Common varieties of paddy take 25 doses of water during the full crop season, while basmati needs only half of that. However, one disadvantage of basmati is that it matures late and it ripens during a period when the monsoon is withdrawing from the region. "
"Bharat Khanna Tribune News Service Mansa, January 20 A ""meagre"" compensation of Rs5,000 for the loss of cotton crop hit by waterlogging has come as a dampener for the farmers in Mansa, who have vowed not to sow the crop next time. The farmers regret the paltry relief came even as they had already suffered a double whammy of low yield, on account of delayed monsoon, and inferior quality crop fetching them poor prices. The district administration has sought Rs5,000 per acre compensation for complete crop loss, Rs3,000 for 75 per cent damage and Rs2,000 for 50 per cent loss. The farmers, on the contrary, have been demanding Rs50,000 per acre. Besides, they have accused the administration of showing the damaged area ""too less"".(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Jagtar Singh Brar, Mansa Chief Agriculture Officer, confirmed that dry weather conditions had checked the growth of cotton plants by 2-3 per cent. He said the Agriculture Department had assessed the losses following a tour to the affected villages. Brar pointed out that the compensation would be sought on the basis of another survey, which would be done by the Revenue Department. The compensation amount, though, could remain the same as stated above. In their survey, agriculture officials recorded crop loss on 6,587 acres in 14 villages of Mansa sub-division and 18 villages in Jhunir, which were hit by waterlogging in September last. The figures show 3,554 acres of land with 75 to 100 per cent damage, 2,274 acres in 50-75 per cent category, 502 acres with 25-50 per cent and 257 acres with less than 25 per cent losses. But the villagers contended that crop on more than 15,000 acres was damaged. ""The delayed rains checked the crop's growth while waterlogging dealt the final blow…. The government figures are far below the actual losses,"" said an affected farmer. The department has shown below-75 per cent damage on 54 acres of land, belonging to 15 farmers, in Musa village even though sarpanch Avtar Singh claimed the affected area was over 200 acres. In Chehlanwala village, the government record showed losses below-50 per cent losses on 70 acres and 50-75 per cent damage on 85 acres. Sarpanch Balla Singh contended that the loss area was around 1,300 acres."
"Archit Watts Tribune News Service Muktsar, January 7 The state government has failed to double the prize money to Rs 2.5 crore for the National Livestock Championship even though Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal promised to do so last year. The five-day event is scheduled to begin tomorrow. The Animal Husbandry Department will hold the championship at Guru Gobind Singh Sports Stadium that requires a minimum of Rs 30 lakh for its repair. The stadium suffered a lot of damage in 2013 monsoon rains, when water accumulated in nearby residential areas was pumped into it. The staircase needs urgent repair. The funds sanctioned last year were insufficient and the authorities could repair only the stage.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); In the past, only breeders from Punjab and neighbouring states such as Haryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat participated in the annual event held during the Maghi Mela. This year, the department is also organising the Progressive Punjab Livestock Expo on the pattern of the expo held at Chapparchiri in February, last year.

He will be accompanied by Animal Husbandry Minister Gulzar Singh Ranike, Chief Parliamentary Secretary Des Raj Dhugga and Financial Commissioner Mandeep Singh Sandhu. Competitions at the championship will be held in 64 categories, including the champion stallion, mare, bull, buffalo and cow. The milching of cows, buffaloes and goats competitions attract huge crowds. Some of the other main events are horse rabina chaal, dance, decoration and camel dance. HS Sandha, Director, Animal Husbandry Department, said, “The total prize money could not be doubled this year. However, the reward in some categories has become twofold.”"
"Tribune News Service Chandigarh, December 27 The ruling Akali Dal today tried to revive the drug-related controversy surrounding Congress MLA from Gidderbaha Amarinder Singh Raja Warring, who has been appointed Indian Youth Congress president. In a statement here, SAD leaders Sikander Singh Maluka, Tota Singh and Sharanjit Singh Dhillon alleged that the appointment had exposed Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi’s “double-speak”. They alleged that Rahul, who claimed himself to be against drugs, had given the charge of the party’s youth wing to a man who, akin to Cabinet Minister Bikram Singh Majithia, had faced drug allegations.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); “Rahul, who claims he is against drugs and had even released false facts to defame the Punjabis, appears to have forgotten that Warring’s connections with a drug smuggler had rocked the state Assembly during its monsoon session. A smuggler, said to be Warring’s personal assistant, gave the MLA Rs 2 lakh as election fund,” they said. The Akali leaders alleged that Warring was a close associate of Gurlal Singh, a notorious drug lord and kingpin of a multi-layered drug trafficking network spread across the North. They alleged Gurlal had, during investigation, admitted to his ties with Warring. Gurlal was arrested from Sirsa in a joint operation conducted by the Punjab and Haryana police. Warring has dubbed the allegations as a political conspiracy. He said he would quit politics forever if the police succeeded in establishing his links with any peddler."

"Gagan K Teja Tribune News Service  Patiala, November 8 Nabha is one of the best cities in Patiala district as far as the condition of roads is concerned. It is even better than most areas of the royal city. Almost the entire population has access to drinking water. Sewerage has been laid in all areas within the municipal limits. Civic amenities But the princely town is beset with certain problems. Encroachments in the main markets is an area of concern. Another problem is waterlogging. The problem turns chronic during the monsoon. Poor drainage system continues to irk city residents. Parts of the city areas remain submerged in water during the rainy season causing inconvenience to the residents.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ }); Another problem is that of sanitation. Heaps of garbage can be seen in different parts of the city. The council has failed to find a solution to dispose of garbage outside its limits. Amarjit Singh from Dulladi Gate said though the condition of roads was satisfactory, they faced a lot of inconvenience during the monsoon. “The drainage system is poor due to which water accumulates at many places that makes life difficult for commuters,” he said. Navdeep Singh of Ekta Colony said: “Most streets remain in the dark due to non-functional streetlights. It poses risk to residents. Another problem bugging the city is that of garbage dumps in residential areas. The administration is least bothered to get these cleared.” The city has a population of about 66,215. The number of registered voters is around 47,000. The process of revising electoral rolls is underway. Annual budget Property tax, sale of property, regularisation of houses and VAT are the main sources of income for the council. The municipal council has an annual budget of Rs 20 crore. Of this, Rs 10.5 crore is utilised to pay salary to employees. A sum of Rs 8.78 crore is spent on development works, including maintenance of roads, water supply and sewerage. Another Rs 45 lakh has been earmarked for contingency expenses. Infrastructure Despite having a population of over 66,000, the city does not have a proper bus stand. The existing bus stand is not properly maintained with garbage and filth littered all around. There is no seating arrangement for passengers. Nabha has more number of government and private schools as compared to the other councils in the district. There are 17 government schools and 48 private and aided schools having around 20,000 students. Certain schools are among the best in the district. Health services too are up to the mark. Nabha is located at a distance of 22 km from Patiala. In case of any emergency, patients are brought to Government Rajindra Hospital. Political graph The political scenario in Nabha is confusing with factionalism affecting both the SAD and the Congress. Akali leader Makhan Lalka and Maninder Singh Mani are at loggerheads. The Congress too is divided into two groups owing allegiance to local MLA Sadhu Dharmsot and Kaka Randeep Singh. The ruling SAD-BJP had formed the house during the 2008 council elections. This time, it could be anybody’s game. "
"Tribune News Service Rajpura, November 30 Even though Rajpura municipal council has covered almost 100 per  cent population under piped drinking water and sewerage facilities have been provided in  85 per cent areas falling under the municipal council, there are numerous  complaints pertaining to the quality of water being received in government  supply and choking of sewerage lines. Residents time and again have been  holding dharnas against the council as the sewerage lines are very old. As a result, drinking water and sewage gets mixed. The government  supply of water is very poor on quality and a large number of people are now  relying on submersible pumps. During monsoon, there is waterlogging in many areas. So there is always a threat  of outbreak of vector-borne diseases. Even though Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir  Singh Badal had laid the foundation stone of a sewage treatment plant  for Rajpura over a year ago, the land has not been acquired  yet. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });Managing traffic continues to be a prime concern for the council  as the city has a population of almost 1 lakh and the older areas are very  congested. There are hardly any parking places along the inner markets,  due to which people park their vehicles on the road. Annual budget The  municipal council (MC) has a budget of Rs 39.14 crore annually. Out of this, Rs 18.47 crore is dedicated to the establishment, including salaries. Around Rs 19.14 crore is spent on development works which  include maintenance of roads, operation and maintenance of water supply and  sewerage. Rs 1.12 crore has been earmarked for the contingency  expenses. Income source The cumulative total income from  property tax, sale of property, regularisation of houses and VAT are their main  sources of income. Infrastructure Since Rajpura falls on national highway number 1, its rail and bus connectivity with the capital is  very good. However, traffic regulation continues to be a big problem in the city. Even  though a bus halt has been built on the national highway, the main bus service  continues to be operated from the old bus stand that is located in the heart of  the city. This leads to heavy traffic and chaos. Moreover, there are massive  encroachments in different markets of the city, especially Talli Ala Chowk  where the vendors park their 'rehris' on the roads, making the area very  congested. Education Rajpura has 19 government schools and 39  private and aided schools with a student strength of approximately 20,000.  There is a sufficient number of private schools as well which cater to the large  population. However, if one looks at the government schools, there is certainly a  need to improve the infrastructure in a few of them. Many rooms of various schools  have been declared unsafe. The schools having written to the government  seeking grants to construct more rooms. The town has a good number of hospitals and  private clinics, apart from the community health centre which caters to the  entire population. Political graph In 2008, SAD-BJP came to power in council elections. However, the political situation in Rajpura is slightly in favour of the Congress considering the fact that city residents are often found protesting against the council for non-availability of adequate drinking water and choked sewerage. Moreover, Rajpura MLA Hardyal Singh Kamboj is actively binding city residents against the SAD-BJP alliance.
